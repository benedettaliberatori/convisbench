The clip features an individual performing the side plank hold exercise. The person is on their right side on a yoga mat in a well-lit room with natural light streaming through the window, enhancing visibility and creating a serene atmosphere. They are dressed in activewear â€“ a grey tank top and grey leggings. The individual's right arm is bent at an approximate 90-degree angle, hand supporting their body above the wrist, and legs are stacked with the bottom leg on top of the other, feet pointing downward. Their left arm extends outwards, hand gripping the mat for support as they maintain the pose. Several houseplants can be seen in the background, contributing to a calm and fresh environment suitable for yoga. The wall color is white, which contrasts with the darker yoga mat and the green plants. A progress bar and tip for the exercise appear on the screen.
