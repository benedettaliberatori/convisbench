The video depicts an individual performing pruning on a young tree during autumn. The person is dressed in a green fleece jacket, red beanie, and yellow gloves, standing in a wide-open field with sparse grass and leafless trees in the background. The sky is overcast, and the ground is covered with dry leaves, suggesting it's a cool day. The person starts by cutting a branch off the tree, then proceeds to use a tape measure to gauge the distance from the ground to the branch being cut. The text in the screen indicates measurements used for the pruning, such as '2 ft. tall + 4 = 4 ft.' and '20 ft. tall + 7/4 = 5 ft.' This suggests the person is following a specific pruning technique or formula. The colors in the scene are muted, with earthy tones being prevalent due to the season and open field.
