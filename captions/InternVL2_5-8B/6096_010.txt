A person, likely female from the patterned apron and wristwatch, is preparing an apple pie. She starts by mixing sliced apples with flour in a glass bowl to prevent them from turning brown. The scene is set on a wooden table. There is another unbaked pie crust lying flat beside a larger rolled-out one, indicating pie preparation steps. The apples are being coated evenly with flour with visible motions as she mixes and tosses them. Each frame shows progress: beginning with dry flour, then adding apples, followed by thorough mixing. The environment suggests a home kitchen setup with natural lighting contributing to the warm ambiance. The apples are pale green, contrasting with the orange of the peel and clear bowl.
