In the video, we see a close-up view of a person's wet hair on mannequin head, which is positioned slightly to the right of the frame. The stylist's hand, adorned with a black watch, holds sectioning combs and scissors, indicating a hairstyling process. The first frame shows a hair section being held with a gold comb with black grip. The stylist's hands skillfully pull apart strands with a wider comb, then adjust the section with a fine-toothed comb. In the second and third frames, the stylist uses a golden clip to section off the hair for cutting. The final two frames demonstrate the precise snipping action as the stylist cuts straight across each section before moving onto the next.
