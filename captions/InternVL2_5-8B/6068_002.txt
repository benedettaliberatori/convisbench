In a modern kitchen, a person in a black t-shirt and blue apron is cooking patties. They use a frying pan while wearing gloves for hygiene. The person pours oil into the pan from a green bottle, then places raw hamburger patties into the heated oil to cook. Using a metal grater, they press down on the patties, revealing they are meat balls. The kitchen has dark cabinets, a white countertop, and various cooking utensils. In the background, there's a microwave and other kitchen equipment. The lighting is bright, highlighting the sizzling patties and the glistening oil in the pan. The focus is on the cooking process and ensuring the meat sticks together properly.
