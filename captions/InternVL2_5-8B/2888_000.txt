The video begins with a man walking down a path in a large arena and starts a race with the dogs. The man is the starting gate person and his job is to release the dogs from the starting gate. The dogs all go running around the arena to try their best to win the race. However, some of the dogs get tired and lay on the ground. The man then stops them from continuing the race and calls the dogs to stop. After they have all stopped, the man goes to the other side of the arena. The video captures the whole process of the man starting the race, the dogs running around the arena, some getting tired, and the man stopping the race and the dogs laying down on the ground.
