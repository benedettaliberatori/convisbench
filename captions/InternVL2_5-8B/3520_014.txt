The clip features a person in a well-lit room with white walls and a modern aesthetic, practicing a side plank hip raise exercise. They are wearing gray leggings and a black sports top, demonstrating good form on a black exercise mat. The subject starts with their side arm supporting their body on a red pad and hip lifted, then returns to the plank position, completing one full repetition of the exercise. The room has minimal decor, with green plants adding a touch of nature. A countdown overlay shows the remaining number of repetitions, changing from 24 to 1, indicating increasing fatigue. A small graphic in the top right tracks progress at 78-83% efficiency. Text tips overlay in the left frame provide instructions for correct form and technique.
