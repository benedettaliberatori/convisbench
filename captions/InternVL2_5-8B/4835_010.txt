In an outdoor setting, a man wearing a floral-patterned shirt stands before a grill, preparing food. He mentions it is nearly time to eat, expressing a hope that the meal will be'really good' despite not cooking much. In his hand, he holds something he describes as 'cankerworm,' to give viewers an idea of the food's small size. The man suggests putting the food on its own dish due to its minuscule size. He begins by using a grilling tool but decides to add items to what appears to be a tortilla wrapper ('cankerworm'). The environment is casual with a patio setting, featuring outdoor kitchen appliances and decor. There are items on the table such as a paper napkin holder, wooden cutting board, white plates, and bottles. The lighting suggests it's daytime, and the overall atmosphere is homely and relaxed.
