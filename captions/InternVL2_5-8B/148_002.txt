The video depicts a process in an area designated for handling durians, which often have strong odors. The first frame showcases a close-up of someone cutting open a durian with a knife on a yellow surface. The knife has a dark blade and a silver handle. The person's hands are partially visible, with one hand holding the durian and the other operating the knife. The second frame continues this action but from a slightly different angle, still emphasizing the cutting action. In both frames, the durian is green, spiky, and its thick, creamy flesh is exposed. The environment appears to be inside a building with tables for processing. Ambient lighting illuminates the scene clearly without causing harsh shadows or overexposure.
