In a kitchen with white cabinets and a red floor mat, a person is working on a wooden cutting board with dough. The person, dressed in a dark t-shirt, rolls and pinches the dough into a layered form. On the board beside them are a knife and bowls containing other ingredients. The dough transitions from raw to partially folded as the person's hands manipulate it with skill. The environment suggests an at-home cooking scene with natural lighting and domestic utensils. Each frame marks the progression of folding in unison with the voice-over instructions.
