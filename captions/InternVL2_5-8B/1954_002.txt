The video shows a step-by-step process of making a DIY craft project. A person's hands are seen interacting with a clear glass bottle and a blue colored powder. Initially, the bottle is empty and placed on a surface. Then, the blue powder is poured from a container into the bottle. The person stirs the powder to create a blue liquid inside the bottle. Subsequently, the bottle is placed into an oven, indicating a heat or heat setting is used to change the color temperature. After the sequence, the bottle is shown to have lost its blue color and appears clear again, suggesting the initial blue color was a result of the heat rather than the color of the liquid itself. The craft is likely showcasing an experiment with color reactions under different conditions.
