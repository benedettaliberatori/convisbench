The video clip features a close-up, high-resolution view of a raw pork belly positioned on a cutting board labeled 'BICULEAN.' The pig's flesh is a mix of light pink and white hues with visible marbling of fat and muscle. The belly appears to be of a medium size, indicating it may be intended for a meal for several people. The cutting board is placed on a kitchen countertop, likely made of a composite material with a rough texture. Surrounding the pig belly are the hands of an unseen person, who is peeling off the protective wrapping. The lighting is natural, suggesting daylight illumination. Subsequent images show the wrapper being peeled away, revealing a smooth, glistening skin that contrasts with the marbled flesh underneath.
