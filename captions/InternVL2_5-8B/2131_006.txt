The video frames depict a sequence of someone preparing a roasted vegetable or cauliflower dish, likely following a vegan recipe given the context of the video title. In the frames, we see hands dipping pieces of cauliflower into a mixture, presumably a marinade or seasoned coating. The cauliflower pieces are white with some yellow hints, indicating that they might be raw or partially roasted. The person's hands are using a purple silicone spatula to spread the coating evenly on the vegetables. The kitchen counter is visible with various items such as spice containers, salt, and vinegar bottle in the background. The lighting appears natural, illuminating the counter clearly. The mixture being prepared seems to be in a glass bowl, and it is being transferred onto a tray. The colors in these frames are predominantly white from the cauliflower, purple from the silicone spatula, and neutral tones from the kitchen decor.
