The video clip takes place in a well-lit dance studio with a wooden floor and ballet barres. In the foreground, a person wearing a blue t-shirt, black shorts, and sneakers performs an exercise. The exercise involves moving the leg sideways with an elbow to the knee, apparently targeting the gluteal muscles. The environment is clean and spacious, with natural light coming from the windows behind. As the person moves their leg, numbers appear on the screen, indicating how many repetitions have been completed. A timer graphic is also present, suggesting the exercise should be done for a specific duration. After completing 10 reps as per the instructional text 'Elbow to Knee,' the exercise count changes to '20'. Another text overlay 'Next: Front Step' indicates a transition to another exercise step.
