The video opens with a warmly lit museum entrance, featuring a sign for the Phuket Trickeye Museum. The camera then moves into the museum, revealing various artworks displayed on plain walls with a high ceiling equipped with spotlights. The environment is calm with no visitors in sight. As we progress, we see a corridor lined with a series of framed pictures, each showing a different character or object. The art style suggests playful and whimsical themes. The camera then transitions to a grand hall with stone-like walls and floor, where an interactive exhibit area is visible. There are people walking around, some interacting with the exhibits. The decor is contemporary with clean lines and bright artificial lighting. Visible decorations include vivid murals and illuminated signs, contributing to the vibrant yet sophisticated ambiance of the museum.
