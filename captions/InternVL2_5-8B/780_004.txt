The scene takes place in a kitchen, likely at a countertop with a wooden cutting board illuminated by natural light. A person's hands are seen slicing a red onion with a knife, which already has some slices, indicating prior cutting activity. The kitchen appears orderly with a glass bowl that contains thinly sliced cucumbers, waiting to be mixed with the onions. The red onion is crisp and vibrant red, cutting through it reveals the inner layers of purple and white. After the onions are sliced, they are placed into the glass bowl alongside the cucumbers. The hands then proceed to mix both ingredients together by hand, creating a salad. The lighting in the scene appears warm and is possibly coming from a nearby window. There are other objects like a vase with purple flowers on the counter, adding a touch of color to the environment.
