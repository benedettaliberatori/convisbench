The video clip shows someone's arm holding a black and silver digital food thermometer above an open barbecue grill with black grates. The person is checking the internal temperature of a thick slice of dark seasoned steak resting on the grill. Steam rises as the thermometer is inserted into the meat. The temperature displayed on the thermometer is 128 degrees Fahrenheit. The environment appears to be outdoors with good daylight illuminating the scene, suggesting it is daytime. The steak looks juicy and well-seasoned with a charred, browned exterior indicating it's being grilled. The steam and the rising temperature suggest that the meat is in the process of cooking to the desired doneness. The person has completed the first step of cooking the steak and is now measuring its temperature to determine if it is ready to be removed from the heat.
