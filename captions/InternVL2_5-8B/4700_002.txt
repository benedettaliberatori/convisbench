The clip features a group of cyclists in motion, riding on a road surrounded by greenery. It's daytime, and the sky is partly cloudy with hints of blue and scattered white clouds. The cyclists wear various colored jerseys, with one in the foreground donned in pink. The road appears wet, suggesting recent rain. Overlaid on the video is data from a fitness tracking application, showing metrics such as distance ('21.9'), heart rate (ranging from 71 to 77 beats per minute), cadence ('33 to '24 per minute), and time (6:17 and 6:17:54). Additionally, there is a race chart at the top showing a bike route with 'Out & Back' markers and a map below it with time progressions. The colors in the video are vibrant, with the reds and greens of the road and riders contrasting against the natural background.
