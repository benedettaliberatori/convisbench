The video clip is set aboard a moving boat on an overcast day with choppy water, suggesting strong winds commonly associated with mackerel fishing conditions. The deck of the boat is white with fishing rods lined up on it. Two individuals are present; one, wearing a black hoodie with the name 'SIMMS' on it, maneuvers a fishing rod actively while the other, in a grey jacket, handles a gaff. The sea is grey-blue, and the sky is similarly hued. As they prepare to land a fish, gloved hands are visible. The fish thrown into the boat appears large and struggles, indicating a successful catch. The rod bends under the fish's weight, and its thrashing is evident in the boat's motion.
