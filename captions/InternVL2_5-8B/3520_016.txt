In a well-lit, spacious room, a person wearing grey workout attire is performing an isolated leg exercise. They are on a black yoga mat, surrounded by houseplants, white walls, and a visible light switch. Their left knee is touching the floor while their right knee is suspended above it, resembling the leg position of a push-up. The room's floors are wooden, and natural light floods in through off-frame windows. The video is captured with high definition, suggesting it's part of a fitness application interface, as evidenced by the timer, workout tips, and instructions displayed on-screen. The person is executing a mountain climber hold technique, where they alternate keeping one leg stationary while extending the opposite leg forward as if climbing a mountain. Their form is meticulously highlighted in the instructional overlays.
