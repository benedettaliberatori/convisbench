In a brightly lit kitchen setting, a person's hands are shown preparing black jack bananas, commonly known as saba bananas. The hands peel away the tough exterior of the bananas, revealing the inside which is often more appealing to the taste. After peeling, the bananas are placed on a wooden cutting board. A knife is then employed to slice the bananas diagonally on the board, with a focus on creating consistent angles for even cooking in dishes such as baking or grilling. The peeled bananas appear white and fleshy, while their skins show the characteristic markings of black jack bananas. The action is deliberate and careful, indicating attention to detail in the preparation process. The hands are well-manicured, wearing a dark sleeve suggesting casual home attire.
