The shot is taken from a high angle, giving a bird's-eye view of a soccer field during what appears to be the golden hour with ample ambient light. In the center of the field, 'CHATTANOOGA MULES' is written, indicating the location or name of the team. We see players in white jerseys and black shorts, likely the attacking team, with one player wearing number 23 prominently. There's an opponent in an orange goalkeeper jersey, standing ready to defend. The white-jerseyed team is in possession of the ball, and one player is executing a pass towards the goal area. The green artificial turf is marked by white boundary lines. Spectators are visible in the background stands, and there's a slight breeze moving the net inside the goal frame.
