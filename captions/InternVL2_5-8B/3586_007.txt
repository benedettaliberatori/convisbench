In a forested river setting with sunlight filtering through the trees, a group of four people in safety gear—helmets, life vests over jackets—are rafting. They're in a yellow inflatable raft, suggesting an adventurous outdoor activity. All wear blue helmets, with the closest person sporting a yellow life vest over a blue jacket. The river's water is clear with gentle rapids, and the group appears engaged in teamwork, using paddles to navigate. There's lush greenery on the banks. It seems to be daytime given the bright lighting conditions. The environment is tranquil aside from the occasional sound of paddling and splashing water. The group moves in synchronization, indicating they are skilled at rafting. At the start, two individuals sit close together at the back while the front is slightly apart.
