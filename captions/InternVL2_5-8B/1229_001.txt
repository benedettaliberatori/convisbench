The clip begins with a medium close-up of an individual wearing a dark top and a white cap with the text 'VGA' on it, running towards the camera. The person appears to be talking to the camera as they move, with an environment that suggests a quiet street possibly leading to a beach. The sky is overcast, suggesting potentially cold or gloomy weather. As the individual continues, the camera remains stationary for a few moments before panning to follow the runner. The background reveals a pebbled beach, a pavilion structure, and buildings that resemble a seaside town with a traditional British architectural style. The colors are muted due to the overcast sky; the dominant shades are grays and browns, enhancing the calm yet somber atmosphere of the scene.
