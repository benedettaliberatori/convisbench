In a well-lit sewing room, a person is working on a fabric craft project. They are using a white Singer sewing machine to attach Velcro, commonly known as hook and loop. The person's hands are shown in close-up, manipulating the different layers of fabric and Velcro. Initially, they fold the fabric pieces with the Velcro side attached. The cut patterns on each piece suggest they might be parts of a quilt or a similar textile project. Next, the person carefully aligns these pieces on a grid-covered sewing table for better precision. A small yellow rotary cutter is visible for measurement accuracy. They then use an iron to bond the pieces onto another part of the fabric, ensuring a tight and secure attachment. The final frames show the attached pieces laid out flat on the table, revealing a pattern in the fabric being created.
