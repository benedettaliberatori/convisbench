In the video, a person in a red workout outfit is performing a bicep curl exercise using dumbbells. They are in a gym with various pieces of equipment visible, including weight racks and exercise machines in the background. The person is standing with their feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and performing the exercise in a repetitive motion. The environment looks well-lit, likely with artificial lighting, and the gym has yellow and black walls adorned with a large mural of a muscular figure. In the last frame, another person in blue attire is seen bending forward on a bench, seemingly stretching or resting. The text 'BENT OVER REAR DELT ROW' on the bottom of the frames indicates the specific exercise being performed.
