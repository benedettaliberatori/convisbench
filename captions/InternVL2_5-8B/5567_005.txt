In a setting rich with hanging durians as a backdrop, two individuals stand. One is holding a durian fruit, indicating its characteristics. The durian has a round shape and its spikes are far apart, which makes it difficult to open due to a thick husk. The individual speaking emphasizes the fruit's thick husk as the primary reason for its toughness. They demonstrate the fruit's shape and structure while discussing its features. The environment is an indoor space with ample lighting that highlights the green-skinned durian and wooden shelving. The scene includes graphical overlays, such as a text bubble naming the fruit as 'Lei Gong (God of Thunder)'.
