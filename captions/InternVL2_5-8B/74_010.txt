The video clip features an outdoor setting with a woman demonstrating the 'Triceps Dip' exercise. She is positioned on a bench in a park with green foliage and clear skies visible in the background. The woman is wearing a maroon tank top, black capri leggings, and black sports shoes. She has a small black object with a striped side held against her chest. The sunlight suggests it's either morning or afternoon. She begins in a seated position with feet flat on the ground and knees bent. As she explains the triceps dip exercise, she adjusts herself by leaning forward to provide a more stable surface for the dips. Throughout her demonstration, her movement is controlled and steady to show the correct technique to the viewer.
