The clip showcases a close-up of a tattooed individual's hands working meticulously on a mannequin head, demonstrating a hair styling technique that emulates a French cut. The environment is bright with white walls, emphasizing the focus on the mannequin's hair, which has a brown hue with some volume and texture. The person is using scissors, specifically designed for stylists, with an orange handle, along with a large comb. They are snipping the hair carefully, working in sections, ensuring a straight line at the nape of the neckâ€”a hallmark of the French cut. The person's tattooed arms are partially visible, suggesting a person confident in hairstyling. The lighting is even and bright, casting no shadows and providing clarity to the haircutting process.
