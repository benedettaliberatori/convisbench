In a room with a muted color palette, a person is playing a bass guitar. The bass has a black and white checkerboard pattern, with a sticker on its bridge. The player wears a red and black jacket, white shirt, and black pants. Hands are actively strumming the strings and finger positions are noted as they play 'Godsmottagande'. The fingers are moving quickly, indicating the difficulty level of the piece. In the background, a white keyboard is partially visible, signifying the presence of other musical instruments or the setting being a practice room. The environment seems casual and typical of an indoor music practice space. Lighting is bright but not harsh, creating a homely atmosphere conducive to music practice.
