In a kitchen with tiled walls, someone is deep-frying carrots that appear to have been sliced into thick pieces. The carrots are bright orange, indicating they are freshly fried and retain a crispy texture. A fry basket is being used to remove the fried carrots from a pot of hot oil, which is bubbling vigorously around them. The frying utensil suggests a homemade cooking environment. After removal from the oil, the basket is lowered onto a large, empty bowl to catch all the fried carrot slices. The oil inside the pot is a golden hue, indicating it's hot and perhaps the exact temperature for frying these vegetables. The lighting is warm, likely from overhead kitchen lights, enhancing the golden color of the oil and the vibrant orange of the cooked carrots.
