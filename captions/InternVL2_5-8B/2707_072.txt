The video clip presents two hikers from behind, traversing a rugged terrain that appears uneven and rocky. The hiker in the foreground is wearing a long-sleeve blue shirt with beige sleeves, dark pants, and a large hiking backpack loaded with gear. The other hiker is partially visible and is outfitted in an orange and grey backpack. Both carry their own drinking containers. The environment is barren and devoid of vegetation, suggesting a high altitude or tundra-like setting. The color palette is muted, with the dominant colors being the blues of the sky and the brownish tones of the earth and rocks. The light appears natural and harsh, indicative of bright daylight with clear visibility. There's a sense of solitude and focus as they move forward, possibly preparing for an activity.
