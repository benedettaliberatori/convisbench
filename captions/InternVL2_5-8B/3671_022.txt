The video showcases a person's hands washing a large piece of raw meat, likely pork, under running water in a stainless steel kitchen sink. The hands are methodically scrubbing the meat to clean it, turning it over periodically to ensure cleanliness on all sides. The environment is a domestic kitchen with white countertops. The meat looks fresh with visible marbling and some green herbs on its surface, indicating it may have been seasoned. The lighting is bright, likely from overhead kitchen lights, making the scene clear and well-lit. The hands work diligently, suggesting experience or knowledge of food preparation. The surrounding area appears clean, with no other objects in the frame but for the faucet and sink.
