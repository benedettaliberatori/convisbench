The scene unfolds in a narrow, rugged canyon with warm, earth-toned walls. The ground appears to be covered partially with snow. Two individuals, one in a green jacket and black pants, and another in a black jacket and blue shorts, are seen preparing for what seems like an activity involving a plastic water bottle. The person in green is crouched down, handling the bottle while the other stands nearby with hands on hips. As the camera pans right, we see another figure wearing pink top and blue jeans at a standstill. In successive frames, the person in green transitions from a crouched position to a squat and rises, moving towards the right of the frame where the pink-clad individual waits. No facial expressions are discernible, and the focus is on their actions rather than emotions or dialogue.
