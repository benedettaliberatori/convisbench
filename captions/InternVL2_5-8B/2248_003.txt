The clip is shot from a first-person perspective of someone involved in treasure hunting. A handheld device, likely a metal detector, dominates the frame, its screen displaying '1:43' and other indecipherable readings. As the device is dragged through the murky, light brown beach water, it creates ripples and sand disturbances, suggesting a search methodical and thorough. The environment appears to be a serene beach during daylight, with clear skies and sunlight reflecting off the water. There are glimpses of a person's foot wearing a white shoe, possibly the treasure hunter's other hand or a companion's, reaching into the water possibly assisting in the search or collecting items. The water's surface is sandy and reflective, hinting at a shallow depth. The colors are natural and warm, dominated by browns of the sand and water, with blue-gray of the equipment screen.
