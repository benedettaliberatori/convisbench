A person, presumably female based on attire and voice, stands in a kitchen preparing a dish. She holds half an avocado pit and a peeled hard-boiled egg near the sink, cutting ingredients. The kitchen is equipped with white cabinets, a black coffee maker, and an orange appliance, possibly a blender. On the counter, there's a colander with hard-boiled eggs, a butter knife cutting board, and an assortment of spitz cookies. The person, wearing a leopard print off-shoulder top, is mixing butter into the egg yolks. In a separate pot, water is boiling, suggesting these eggs have been boiled. She sprinkles paprika onto the prepared egg mixture. A spoon and jar of paprika sit on the counter. The kitchen has neutral tones with pops of orange and brown from the appliances, creating a cozy atmosphere.
