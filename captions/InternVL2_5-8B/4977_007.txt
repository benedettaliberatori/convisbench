In a well-lit kitchen sink basin, a stainless steel frying pan rests. The first frame indicates the intention to clean, as white vinegar is poured into the pan, creating bubbles. The person's hands are visible, one with a red glove, suggesting safety or preference. In subsequent frames, we see the frying pan now covered in soapy bubbles, indicating thorough soaking. The yellow sponge held above the pan is being used for scrubbing, and water from the faucet is used to rinse off the soapy residue. The environment remains consistent with a clean kitchen sink. The person's hand movements are deliberate and efficient, showing a practiced technique for cleaning. The colors in the scene are quite neutral except for the red glove and yellow sponge, which add contrast.
