In a well-lit, modern kitchen, a man in a dark apron over a black t-shirt is preparing marinated chicken wings. He wears black gloves and stands at a counter. In front of him is a large white roasting pan with chicken wings, onions, and sliced lemons. The person is basting the chicken with a golden liquid, likely orange juice, from a small glass bowl. His movements are precise and careful, indicating experience with cooking. In the background, stainless steel appliances and a marble countertop suggest a professional setting. He then places the pan on a counter and begins to cover it with aluminum foil, suggesting an intention to cook it further, possibly in an oven. Various cooking utensils and a bowl of flour are also visible, hinting at steps that were used in preparation.
