The setting is a well-lit indoor gym with various pieces of equipment, including weight machines, and a white canvas-covered floor. The environment appears clean and organized. A male individual, dressed in a black sleeveless top and black shorts with a white Nike logo, performs cardio warm-up exercises. He starts with jumping jacks, executing them with swift leg movement and arm swing. Next are air squats; he performs them with control, legs shoulder-width apart and arms reaching towards the floor. Following this, he does front lunges, his stride extending as he balances on one leg, with the other knee touching the ground. Lastly, he performs push-ups in an upward plank position with hands apart wider than shoulder-width. The room's lighting casts clear shadows on the workout area, emphasizing the exercises.
