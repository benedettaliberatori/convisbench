The scene is an outdoor horticultural setting where a person, wearing gloves and a dark cap, is working with a Prickly Pear cactus and a terracotta pot. The person is in the process of moving the cactus out of the pot for replanting. A blue basin filled with dry soil is prominently featured; the person scoops it with a white gardening spade and adds it to the new pot. Surrounding the blue basin are other pots and plant-related materials. The cactus, green with spines, contrasts against the brown terra cotta and muted background. A gloved hand appears, carefully handling the prickly plant and pot, indicating care and precision in the planting process. The daylight provides natural lighting, casting soft shadows and highlighting textures.
