A man is demonstrating an exercise routine in a living room with a couch, chair, bookshelf, and a window. He wears dark shorts and black wristbands. The room is lit with natural light, and a gray exercise mat is on the floor. He begins kneeling on the mat with dumbbells in hand, focusing on his abdominal muscles. The text on the screen provides instructions for breathing and engaging the abs. He then moves into a plank position, lowering his torso towards the floor while maintaining balance on his forearms and toes. He performs a sequence of movements known as planche push ups, showcasing control and core strength. The environment appears calm and residential, suitable for home workouts.
