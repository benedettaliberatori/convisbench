In an evening setting under artificial lights, a black horse drags a single-horse carriage with a number '13' on its side. The carriage is being maneuvered by a person dressed in a pink shirt and blue pants with a helmet, suggesting a competitive or exhibition event. The track appears to be a dirt oval, enclosed by white fences and spectator stands beyond which an audience is watching. A banner with 'NCE Horses' is also visible. The environment suggests this is an equestrian event. The light is dim with the main illumination coming from stadium floodlights casting shadows on the track. The colors present are muted due to the lighting conditions; the horse's coat is glossy black contrasting against the lighter surroundings, and the carriage exhibits a sleek black finish with metallic elements. Spectators can be seen in the stands though details are vague due to the distance and lighting.
