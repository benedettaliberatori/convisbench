The video clip opens with a voice-over stating 'I'm going to give this part right here' followed by an assurance 'DON'T WORRY'. In the frame, two rectangular sponge pieces are laid out side by side on a textured surface, possibly a table. One piece has a bright green foam-like material placed on it, while the other is coated with white paint in horizontal stripes. A hand wearing a watch on the left wrist holds a white plastic squeeze bottle in the first frame, dispensing a white liquid onto the green foam of the sponge. In the subsequent frames, the hand switches to holding a small white spoon, using it to tap and fluff up the white foam, possibly to create a textured appearance. The environment seems like a craft area with items in the background, such as a blue sponge-like structure, small sculptures, and colorful objects suggesting creative or DIY activities.
