The video clip takes place in a well-lit kitchen where a person's hands are visible. They are using a metal spoon to loosen freshly baked oatmeal raisin cookies from a silicone baking mat on a wooden cutting board. There are an even number of cookies, twelve in total, arranged neatly in rows. The cookies look golden brown with visible chunks of oat and raisins. The kitchen counter appears clean, and in the background, there's a hint of a potted plant indicating a homey environment. The person's hands move the spoon methodically under each cookie to ensure none stick to the mat. They are wearing what appears to be a blue long sleeve top and are standing at the counter.
