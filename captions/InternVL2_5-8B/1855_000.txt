In an indoor gym environment with various exercise equipment, a person wearing a gray shirt, black pants, and a supportive lifting belt attempts a deadlift. The gym has purple walls, and there are several rack systems throughout. The person starts in a squat position holding a large barbell loaded with black weight plates. They attempt to lift the weight by pushing through the feet. The barbell fails to be raised, causing the lifter to lose balance and fall backward onto their rear end. Other people can be seen in the background engaging in their own workouts or observing. The flooring is a mix of rubber mats and wooden planks. The lighting is bright and evenly distributed across the gym. No visible faces or identities of any individuals, due to blurring.
