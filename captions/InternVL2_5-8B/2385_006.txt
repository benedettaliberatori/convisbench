In the scene, a hairstylist is actively styling a mannequin head with a light brown hairpiece. The environment is minimalistic, with a plain white background that doesn't distract from the hair styling process. The stylist, identifiable by their black and white attire, uses a curling iron to work on the hair. They apply heat from the curling iron to the mannequin's hair, which appears to have multiple hues, possibly depicting the effect of permanent coloring. As they style each section, the stylist demonstrates the transformation with each application of heat, creating soft waves. The hands are well-manicured, adding a professional touch to the video. Bright lighting illuminates the scene, enhancing the golden tones of the hairpiece. There are no other distinct objects in the frame, which keeps the focus solely on the styling process.
