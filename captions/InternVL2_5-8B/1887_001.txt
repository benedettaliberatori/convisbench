The clip opens with a first-person viewpoint of a person inside a shooting range corridor, lined with blue barrels for protection. The character is armed with a semi-automatic handgun, presumably a.45 ACP Glock, as suggested by the voice-over. The corridor walls have yellow lines and numbers indicating the lane numbers, in this case, 7 and 10. The shooter approaches the target area with two white mannequin-like targets positioned at the end. As the clip progresses, the camera advances, slightly swaying as the shooter adjusts their aim. The environment is dimly lit with overhead artificial lighting casting stark shadows. The shooter fires the handgun, and we see the muzzle flash as the casings eject. The clip conveys an intense atmosphere typical of indoor shooting ranges, focusing on precision and recoil management.
