The scene takes place on a soccer field during nighttime, likely during a match or a game. The scoreboard indicates '9:10 BAC 1-2 CAM'. Players in blue and white uniforms are gathered near one end of the pitch by the goalpost, while those in orange and black uniforms are spread across the other half. The players in blue are celebrating, with one player jumping and arms outstretched, seemingly scoring a goal. The crowd is visible in the background, with one side smoking a flare. The field is well-lit by stadium lights, casting shadows of the players. The sidelines show no distinct markings, and the goalposts are white with a net attached. The time '9:10' suggests it's either dusk or pitch with floodlights.
