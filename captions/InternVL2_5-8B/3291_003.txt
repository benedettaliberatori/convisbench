The video takes place in a well-lit, cozy kitchen with white cabinets and stainless-steel appliances. A man in a dark t-shirt stands at a wooden table, rolling out dough with a metal scraper. There's an assortment of raw ingredients on the counter, including bowls of greens, berries, and herbs. The environment is casual and vibrant, enhanced by the presence of kitchen utensils hanging overhead and a whiteboard on the wall. On the table, a ceramic jug holds an undefined liquid. Throughout the sequence, the man converses with another character whose face isn't shown. Their interaction is casual and involves handling food items and preparing the kitchen. Colors in the scene are warm and natural, primarily browns, whites, and greens from the food and kitchen decor.
