The scene takes place in a kitchen, presumably on a gas stove, where a stainless steel pan is being used to cook something. Inside the pan, butter is being melt to create an oil-based mixture for seasoning. The pan is silver with a black handle, matching the typical professional or quality kitchen cookware. The cook uses a wooden spatula to gently stir the melting butter, ensuring it's distributed evenly. In the background, we can see parts of a kitchen counter and another pot with a strainer on top. This pot likely contains the 'frozen dough' mentioned in the voice-over. The kitchen is well-lit, and the overall lighting suggests an indoor setting during the day. The colors in the scene are mostly neutral with the silver of the pan, the white foam from the melting butter, and the natural wood color of the spatula.
