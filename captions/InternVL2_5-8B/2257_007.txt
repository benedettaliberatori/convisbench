The video clip shows a person's hand placing two slices of bread into a bowl of water. The bread is white and appears to be of regular texture, not thick or extra-fine, and not toasted either. The bowl seems to be a regular kitchen bowl made of a dark material, possibly ceramic or porcelain, sitting on a wooden or bamboo shelf. The water inside looks clear with mild effervescence, indicating it might be tap water or slightly carbonated. The lighting seems natural, possibly daylight coming from an adjacent window, highlighting the texture of the bread and the water's surface. There are no additional objects or movements in the background; the focus remains solely on the action of soaking the bread.
