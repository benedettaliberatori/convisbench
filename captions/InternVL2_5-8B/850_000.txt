In the video titled 'Fencing Match | Part 1 with Jiaxuan Zhang', we observe two fencers in a gymnasium, dressed in white protective gear, including masks covering their faces. Both are holding foils and are in a poised, ready stance on an indoor fencing piste, marked with red lines on a light wooden floor. The gym has fluorescent lighting, and there's a score board or timer against the wall with a table underneath it. The walls are a plain, pale color, and there are no windows or decoration. The fencers are focused, and one is stepping forward while lunging with his foil towards his opponent. The other fencer steps back to avoid the lunge and readies for the next move.
