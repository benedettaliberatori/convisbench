The video clip shows a person kneeling on the ground, wearing a hat and casual clothes, working on a remote-controlled airplane. The individual is manipulating various pieces of the airplane, such as the wings and battery packs, which are visible on the open tool bag in front of them. The area surrounding the person is outdoors and appears barren with gravel or a similar substrate. The lighting suggests daytime with bright sunlight casting shadows of the person and objects. No other people or moving objects are present in the frame. The color scheme is mostly neutral â€“ browns, grays, and the occasional red from a container possibly containing the drone parts.
