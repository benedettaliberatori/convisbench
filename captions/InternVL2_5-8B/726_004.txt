The clip begins with a close-up of a person's hands as they hold a small black SIM card between their fingers. They are sitting at a gray table. The individual's nails are clean and well-maintained, with one hand featuring a silver ring. They insert the SIM card into a slot on the underside of a silver-colored mechanical watch face, which has a complex arrangement of dials, gears, and mechanical elements. The person then presses on a lever, presumably to secure the SIM card in place. The lighting is bright and focused, highlighting the metallic sheen of the watch and the smooth texture of the person's skin. The colors are mostly muted, with shades of black, gray, and silver dominating the scene. There are no other significant objects or characters in view.
