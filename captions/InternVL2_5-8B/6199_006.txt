In the video, we see a close-up view of a pan with cooking ingredients being saut√©ed. The pan is non-stick with a dark surface, and the heat has apparently caramelized the sugars in the onions and garlic, giving them a browned appearance. There's oil and possibly butter shimmering on the surface, indicating it is hot. We see minced garlic and diced onions being stirred with a wooden spatula, which creates a sizzling sound. The colors in the pan are primarily different shades of brown, with the onions having hues of white and purple due to their natural color, and the garlic is a golden yellow. The spatula is being used to move the ingredients around evenly, preventing burning. The environment suggests a kitchen setting focused on cooking this specific dish.
