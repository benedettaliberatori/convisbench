In the video, a person is styling a brown mannequin head. They begin by combing through the wet hair to create a base for styling products. Using a matte spray, they dampen the hair for added manageability. Next, they apply styling gel to achieve the desired effect. They use their hands to manipulate the hair into the necessary position, emphasizing the importance of texture over blow-drying. The setting appears to be a professional salon environment with neutral colors and focused lighting to ensure clarity in the demonstration. The mannequin head serves as a practical tool for demonstrating the hairstyling process, with all ingredients required for the tutorial presented on-screen - including gel and spray with visible labels.
