The scene opens with a close-up shot of a stove on the ground with boiling water in a metal pot. There's a person's lower half visible; they are wearing bright blue-green hiking boots and gray pants. The person is seated cross-legged on a grassy field, indicated by the green blades surrounding the stove. Next to the pot, there's a closed silver mug with a blue lid, a blue sachet possibly containing food for meal prep, and a silver spoon resting on it. The stove is white and appears compact for outdoor use. There's natural light suggesting daylight conditions. The colors are mostly natural tones of greens, grays, and the bright blue of the hiking boots providing a pop of color. There is no significant action from the person or object other than a minor hand movement indicating meal preparation.
