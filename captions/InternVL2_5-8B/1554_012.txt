The clip opens with a first-person view where the camera operator is underwater, presumably next to a wooden-like surface. They hold a tool, and their hand, adorned with a blue and black glove, is manipulating rocks. The scene suggests the operator is on a riverbank, as indicated by sunlight, rocks, and clear water. There's a quick transition to the surface, revealing greenery and the river's flow. The camera then pans downwards into shallow water, showing small pebbles and rocks at the bottom. The operator's movements are quick and calculated as they search among the crevices for valuable items. Sunlight filters through the water, casting natural lighting. The overall tone is that of an adventurous exploration for panning and finding treasures. The final shot returns above, focusing on the collected contents - gold particles - collected from the river bed.
