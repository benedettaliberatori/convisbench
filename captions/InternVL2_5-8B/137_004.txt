The video features an individual standing on a clay tennis court. They're dressed in white sports shoes, navy blue shorts, and a white long-sleeve top, paired with a white cap. The athlete demonstrates proper form for a tennis serve, focusing on keeping the arm straight and engaging the core. They first bend the head to elbow while bending one leg and twisting the torso. Then, they transition to a full serving position, preparing to swing the racket. The background shows an overcast sky with clouds, typical of a temperate European climate. There's a tennis net in the foreground, and a residential area with houses can be seen in the distance. An overlay on the screen reads 'KNEE TO ELBOW' as part of the instructional video series. There's also timestamping and episode markers at the bottom.
