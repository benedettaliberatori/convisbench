The clip opens with a woman in winter gear sitting on a ski lift. She is wearing a pink jacket with a white emblem on the left breast area, black ski pants, and is holding a ski pole in her right hand. A ski-lift chair is visible beneath her. She's also wearing gloves, a beanie, and goggles on top, branded with 'Red Bull' logos. It's a bright day with clear skies, and the background reveals snowy mountain ridges under the blue sky. As she sits, text appears at the bottom of the frame indicating 'Anna Gasser AUT' and '2nd Place Laax Open 2017', suggesting her name and her position in the aforementioned event. The light is natural, and the color palette is dominated by the white snow, blue sky, and pink of her jacket.
