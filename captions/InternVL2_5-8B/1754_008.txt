The video clip features a person demonstrating the technique of layering hair for the first time. The hair is light brown, medium length, and laid on a neutral, solid background for clarity. Initially, we see the person's hands working with a comb to section off a portion of hair. The environment is bright with even lighting to enhance the visibility of the hairdressing process. They then proceed to cut the hair vertically across the head to create layers. The tools used include a comb for sectioning and scissors for cutting. The person appears to be careful and precise in their movements. After the trimming, the cut hair is brushed and combed out smoothly with a white-toothed comb to ensure an even layer.
