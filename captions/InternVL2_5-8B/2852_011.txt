The video features a beach setting with a calm ocean and a pier in the background. A person in athletic attire, wearing a neon pink tank top and grey leggings, is demonstrating a half split exercise. They are positioned on a beige mat laid out on the sandy beach. The individual is extending one leg straight out to the side while the other knee is bent, creating a split. A smartphone is propped up with a yoga mat as a stand next to them. There are also a pair of sneakers within reach. The natural daylight is overcast, casting soft shadows on the scene. The beach is mostly empty, suggesting a personal workout space. The text overlay indicates this is exercise number 6 in a set series of workouts.
