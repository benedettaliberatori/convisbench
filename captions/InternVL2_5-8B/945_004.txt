The video clip displays a close-up of a white mixing bowl on a table. A wooden cutting board holds a mixture of brown nuts, which are being poured into the bowl. As the nuts are emptied into the bowl, small pieces of green herbs, likely rosemary, can be seen amongst them. The bowl appears to be on a kitchen countertop, and under the bowl, a red and white checkered cloth is partially visible. The kitchen lighting is bright but not harsh, illuminating the natural colors of the nuts and herbs. There's a contrast between the white bowl and the brown hues of the mixture being transferred from the cutting board, which includes walnut pieces and potential apple additions indicated by the voice-over.
