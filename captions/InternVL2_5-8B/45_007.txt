In a kitchen setting, hands are shown holding a knife and cutting bright red, fresh strawberries on a light-colored wooden cutting board. The person slices the strawberries in half with precision, preparing them for what is suggested as a mixture of ingredients for a pie. The strawberries are juicy and their seeds are visible. There's a metal bowl in the background, slightly out of focus, suggesting preparation for baking. The lighting is natural and bright, highlighting the vibrant red color of the strawberries and giving the scene a clean and fresh atmosphere. The knife has a black handle, contrasting with the light brown wooden cutting board. The environment seems tidy and well-equipped for cooking.
