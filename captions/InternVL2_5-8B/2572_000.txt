The video clip showcases an individual engaged in a range shooting session. The person is positioned to the left of the frame, wearing a light-colored hoodie, and appears to be aiming with both hands on a handgun. They are shooting at two distant, small, white, paper target sheets propped up on wooden easels in an open outdoor range area. The environment is clear with ample daylight illuminating the scene. In the background, there's a hint of blue sky and some leafless trees, suggesting it might be fall or winter. The ground is not visible, but it seems to be a dirt or gravel area. There is a small logo and text 'FRANKPROCTORSHOOTING.COM' visible on the top right corner. The colors in the clip are natural and muted, dominated by earth tones and the dull whites of the targets.
