The video shows a person's hands cutting lamb chops on a cutting board placed on a granite countertop. One hand wears a pink long-sleeved top with jeans visible underneath, while the other is wearing a white watch with a golden band. The person is using a large chef's knife to slice through the meat. The lamb is pinkish-red, fresh and uncooked, suggesting prepping for cooking. Beside the cutting board is a glass bowl with what looks like nuts. There is natural light coming in, possibly from a nearby window, illuminating the scene with a soft glow. The kitchen background includes a sink and various kitchen utensils and appliances, indicating a home kitchen setting.
