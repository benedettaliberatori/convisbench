The scene takes place in a kitchen with a focus on a stovetop where a non-stick pan is placed. The environment looks like a home kitchen with natural ambient lighting. A person is heating olive oil in the pan. The oil is clear with a light golden hue and is being poured steadily from a green glass bottle with a metal cap, not visible in the frames. The pan appears to be heated already, creating a slight shimmer on the oil's surface as it heats up. There is a small amount of oil pooled together, indicating a controlled pour. The stove beneath the pan is not visible. The video does not show any characters' faces or actions beyond the pouring of oil.
