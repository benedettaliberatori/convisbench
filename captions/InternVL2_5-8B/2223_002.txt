The video clip features a person standing outdoors on what appears to be a snowy mountain slope, presumably preparing for snowboarding. They are wearing winter sports attire including a gray vest with sponsor logos, an Under Armour jacket, and other snowboarding gear. The environment suggests a professional sporting event, likely associated with the X-Games, as indicated by the vest. There is snow-covered ground, and the clear sky indicates daytime. In the background, ski lifts are visible, reinforcing the idea of a sports venue. There is little to no natural light suggesting the time could be evening or the location is in the shade. The video has vibrant yet natural colors with blue skies and white snow contrasting against the dark vest and other equipment.
