The video frames show a pair of hands cutting a cluster of white oyster mushrooms from a growing medium contained in a mesh pot or bag. The mushrooms are pale, almost transparent, with a soft and velvety texture. The environment appears to be outdoors during the day, as indicated by natural sunlight and a glimpse of a wooden structure. The cutting process is done with care, as the intention is to carefully detach the mushrooms from their stems without damaging the growing medium beneath. The focus remains on the mushrooms, particularly one large one in the center, while the rest of the cluster is cut away with precise hand movements. There are several mushrooms of various sizes, and some appear ripe while others are still budding.
