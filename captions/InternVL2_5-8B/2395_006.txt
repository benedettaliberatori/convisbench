The video takes place in a dimly lit outdoor corridor with concrete walls and a brick floor. Two individuals are present: one is performing jump squats while the other watches. The person exercising wears black shorts, a black cap, and no shirt, while the observer is dressed in black. There's a cable on the ground, possibly for workout equipment. The jump squats are performed amidst an encouragement to keep a tempo against a music beat. As the session culminates, the numbers from 20 to 1 descend on the wall, indicating each repetition and a countdown to the exercise finish. The light is natural but diffused, suggesting an overcast day. The environment is minimalistic and uncluttered, focusing viewers' attention on the exercise performance.
