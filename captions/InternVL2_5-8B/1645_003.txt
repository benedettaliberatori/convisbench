In a home gym setting, a person in black sleeveless top and gray pants performs a wall handstand. The gym is equipped with a pull-up bar, weight rack, and various workout gear visible in the background. The person begins by positioning themselves upright against the wall, placing their hands down on the floor. They proceed to swing their body upwards and over, using momentum to climb the wall into an inverted position, culminating in a controlled wall handstand. The floor is covered with a black mat to provide grip and cushioning. Natural light seems to be limited, suggesting it could be evening. There is warm artificial lighting present that evenly illuminates the room. A dumbbell is also on the floor.
