The video clip features a man, presumably Wes Ashlock, dressed in traditional rodeo attire consisting of a cowboy hat, long-sleeved shirt, and jeans. He's mounted on a horse, which appears to be a palomino based on its golden-brown coat. Wes is in an enclosed arena filled with dirt, indicated by the earthy ground and fencing visible in the background. Some distant cows can be seen milling about the perimeter. The light is natural and bright, suggesting daytime. Wes is holding the reins of the horse and speaking about an experience related to a wild horse. He gestures with his free hand, emphasizing his story. He mentions the horse's previous owner finding it with a halter and how it learned to stand on its hind legs in a hurry. The environment suggests a ranch setting where cattle handling might occur.
