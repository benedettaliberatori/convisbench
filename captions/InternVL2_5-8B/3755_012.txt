The scene takes place in a commercial kitchen with stainless steel surfaces and cooking equipment. A person is handling French fries, indicating an environment where food is being prepared, likely for sale. The fries are golden and freshly cooked, coming straight from a deep fryer. As the voice-over expresses enjoyment of the fries, the person sprinkles what appears to be seasoning or crispy bits onto the fries in clear plastic bags, ensuring they are seasoned well. The light is bright and artificial, typical of a commercial kitchen. In the background, there are various bottles of condiments and kitchen tools hanging, suggesting an active food preparation space.
