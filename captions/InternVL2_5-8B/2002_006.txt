In a brightly lit outdoor setting, a person is preparing steak on a wooden cutting board. The environment appears open and well-lit, possibly due to natural sunlight, suggesting daytime. The steaks are large, pink in color with visible marbling, suggesting freshness. The person uses a brush to apply a glaze onto the steaks, pouring additional liquid from a small bowl into the brush for application. The glaze appears viscous and glistening, reflecting light as it makes contact with the steaks. The person's hands are visible, and they wear a wristwatch, emphasizing the casual, possibly at-home cooking scenario. To the side, there are lemon wedges hinting at the use of acidity in the recipe. Everything is crisp and focused on the meticulous seasoning process.
