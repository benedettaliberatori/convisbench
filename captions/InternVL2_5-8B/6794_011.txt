In a brightly lit kitchen, a woman wearing a green t-shirt stands by the countertop engaging in food preparation. The environment is tidy with visible kitchen appliances like a blender, orange toaster, and a white bread cooker on the counter. She holds a black cast-iron skillet, into which she pours melted butter, suggesting she's making 'French's.' An egg yolk is visible in a glass bowl, indicating she used it in the mix. She uses a blue silicone spatula to add ingredients into the skillet. The butter's golden hue contrasts with the black of the skillet. Other kitchen items, including a bowl of flour, can be seen in the background. The lighting is warm, likely from natural or soft artificial sources, creating a homely atmosphere.
