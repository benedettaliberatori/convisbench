The video features a person executing the Arnold Press exercise. They are dressed in a black t-shirt with print text and grey workout pants, paired with red sneakers. The person sits on a silver exercise ball, positioned over a white towel laid on a wooden floor. They lift heavy dumbbells from shoulder height to above the head, demonstrating upper body strength. The room appears to be an indoor home environment with rustic brick walls and minimalist furniture: a brown leather chair and a small plant in the background. Warm, natural light illuminates the space, creating an inviting ambience. The focus shifts to emphasize the individual's bicep and shoulder muscles during the exercise, showcasing their physique and workout intensity.
