In a craft room with storage boxes in the background, a woman is engaged in assembling a patchwork pattern on a cutting mat covered with grid lines. Her hands, with a black sleeve on her right arm and a striped shirt, methodically arrange and align pieces of fabric. As she works, she selects alternating pieces - larger ones with stripes and smaller ones with a bold polka dot pattern. A variety of colored fabrics are visible but primarily blue and yellow are prominent. She uses them to follow a pre-drawn pattern, which includes rectangles and irregular shapes. Her workspace is well-lit with natural light, enhancing the bright colors of the fabric against the plain mat. The environment appears orderly and dedicated to crafting, with several tools partially visible around her.
