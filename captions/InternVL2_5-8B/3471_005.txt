In the video, a person in a hat and plaid shirt is pouring a liquid from a clear plastic jug into a red plastic bucket located inside a dimly lit space. The jug is marked with measurement lines and the person appears to be carefully measuring the liquid before pouring out approximately 15 liters. The environment looks like an indoor setting, possibly a shed or warehouse with a corrugated metal wall in the background. The liquid being poured resembles a milky or translucent substance, suggesting it could be some type of raw milk or plant extract commonly used in animal feed. The person's actions are methodical and precise, indicated by the careful pouring technique. Natural light is minimal, implying it may be filtered through windows or open gaps in the structure.
