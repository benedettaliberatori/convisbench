The clip opens with a wide shot showcasing the vast ocean's horizon, with waves crashing dramatically against the rocky shore under a cloudy sky, setting a stormy or dramatic fishing atmosphere. A person in a black jacket and cap is seen reeling in a fish. The scene switches to the individual proudly holding the caught kob, showcasing its impressive size against the fishing gear. The camera captures this moment in a medium close-up shot before returning to a medium shot of the same person reeling in another kob. The environment is quite windy, and the ocean is quite turbulent, which adds intensity to the scene. The color palette is dominated by blues and grays of the sea and sky, contrasting with the black clothing of the individual and the vibrant silver-grey hue of the kob fish.
