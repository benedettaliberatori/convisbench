A woman is working out in a dimly-lit gym environment, using a specific gym machine designed for leg presses called the leg press machine. She's dressed in a blue tank top and grey leggings. The machine has a black seat and metallic components. Initially, she lifts her legs out and down then pulls them back up close to her body. Her hands are placed on the pads near her hips to add weight. She is performing isolated gluteal exercises. The background has various gym equipment, including weights on a rack, some cables, and a mat against the wall. There's also a man standing by, presumably a trainer or spotter, dressed in black attire. The woman appears focused on her technique and muscle engagement.
