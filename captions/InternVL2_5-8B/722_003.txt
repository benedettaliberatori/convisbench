In this scene from an adventure movie, the protagonist, presumably a guide, sits on the ground during daylight, presumably to find and retrieve a crucial item. The guide is dressed in protective gear, including gloves. He wears casual clothes in green and blue, with visible gloves featuring blue details. The ground is bare with some dry grass patches. Initially, his left hand holds a small yellow object while his right hand reaches into the grass. In the second frame, he has a white and blue knife-like tool and the yellow object drops onto the ground. His right hand is ready to operate the tool while the left hand holds onto its handle. In the third frame, his left hand focuses on grasping something small and possibly metallic, while the right hand holds the knife ready for action. The fourth frame shows a clearer view of what looks like a looped metallic part of the item, which he firmly holds between his fingers. The video captures the precision and careful search for lost equipment in the wilderness, illustrating the guide's focus and the delicate nature of the task.
