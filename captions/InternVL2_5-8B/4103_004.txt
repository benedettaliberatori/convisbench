The video begins with a distant, wide shot of a rugged mountainous landscape during dusk with a cloudy sky. Two tents are set up at a high altitude, indicating a camping site. One tent is larger, triangular in shape with a tarp, and the other is dome-shaped, smaller in scale. The ground is rocky and uneven with sparse grass and moss. As the camera moves closer to the larger tent, the details become clearerâ€”a person is partially visible, wearing bright orange, suggesting visibility for safety. The tent is labeled with 'MILEMOTES'. In the background, the mountains loom under the soft light of sunset or sunrise. The camera's movement is slightly shaky, suggesting handheld recording. Colors are muted due to overcast weather, with hints of warm light breaking through the clouds at the horizon, casting a serene glow over the landscape.
