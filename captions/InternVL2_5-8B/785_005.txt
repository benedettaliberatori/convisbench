The video clip takes place in what appears to be a well-stocked bar setting. The person, likely a bartender, is dressed in a white shirt and is in the process of making a cocktail. On the bar counter, there are three distinctly visible alcohol bottles: Aperol, which is light yellow with a label showing its name in red and blue text; Torani, which has a striking red label; and two red glasses without labels. There's also an orange citrus fruit on the left side of the frame. The bartender is using a long bar spoon to stir the mixture in a short glass containing layered orange liquid and dark red liquid on top, indicating layered cocktails such as an Aperol Spritz or Bellini. The environment suggests an upscale or trendy bar atmosphere with an organized dark shelving unit filled with various bottles behind.
