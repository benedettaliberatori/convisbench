The video shows a person's hands mixing ingredients in a clear glass bowl placed on a granite kitchen countertop. In the first frame, the person is adding salt to the flour. The second frame shows them having poured in a yeast mixture, and by the third frame, they are adding olive oil. In subsequent frames, we see the mixture being stirred to combine these ingredients. The countertop also has a measuring jug, indicating a baking recipe process. The bowl is mostly white with splatters of flour, indicating the process is underway. The olive oil appears as a dark greenish liquid as it's added. The lighting is bright and consistent, suggesting an indoor environment with artificial light.
