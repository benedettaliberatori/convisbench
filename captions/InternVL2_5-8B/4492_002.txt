The clip opens with a medium shot of a person in a blue top standing in a well-lit, modern kitchen. They are holding a box of Collezione cheese gnocchi and explain that they require less salt than regular gnocchi. The camera then pans up to show the kitchen's details, including white cabinets, a double-door fridge, a bowl of bananas, a bunch of yellow and red flowers, and a bottle of what appears to be olive oil on the counter. The person gestures towards the pot on the stove while mentioning the heat required to cook the gnocchi. Close-up shots focus on the cooking pot and a blue flame visible under it, indicating the stove is on. The lighting is bright, highlighting the cleanliness and orderliness of the kitchen environment.
