In a workshop setting, a person's hands are shown working meticulously on a knife handle which is clamped into a vise. The video shows the precise placement of four large rivets into holes drilled in the handle. The handle appears to be made from aluminum with a brushed finish. The knife blade, sharp with a reflective steel surface, rests atop the handle, partially visible. The workshop environment includes items like a red fire extinguisher and equipment in the background. One of the rivets is secured in place, while the person is readying the others for hammering. The lighting is bright, illuminating the workspace with clarity. The focus remains on the hands and the knife, demonstrating a step in knife assembly or repair.
