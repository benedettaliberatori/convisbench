A person is demonstrating a garden technique in an outdoor setting, likely a backyard. It's daytime with natural light, casting soft shadows. The individual is actively shrinking a tree using a string tied to the tree's branches and held taut with a saw, indicating a trimming or training process. The tree is of moderate size, with lush green leaves, and appears to be staked in place with orange ties, ensuring stability for the exercise. The background consists of a white wall with visible patches of wear and a brown fence. There are other potted plants nearby, suggesting a cultivated environment. The ground is covered in grass. The person uses two saws, applying force to ensure the string tightens. After the scene shifts focus away from the individual, the environment remains consistent in the frames provided.
