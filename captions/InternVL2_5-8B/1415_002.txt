The video features a first-person perspective of someone aiming and shooting a handgun at a shooting range. The environment appears to be an indoor facility with concrete walls and multiple targets set up in the distance. Each target is designed to resemble a human figure, positioned at various distances. The shooter moves from one end of the range to another, aiming down sights at each target. As they shoot, the recoil and sound of gunfire are audible. The light is artificial and fairly dim, giving a focus to the illuminated targets and the shooterâ€™s path. The hand holding the handgun is steady and precise, suggesting experience with firearms or professional training. Bullets expel shells that leave visible trails against the targets. The overall color palette is dominated by gray concrete, the darker hues of the firearms, and the orange-brown targets.
