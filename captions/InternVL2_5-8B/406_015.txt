The video clip features the iconic Park Güell in Barcelona, an ornate public park with the famous architect Antoni Gaudí. The clip begins with an aerial view, showcasing the unique architectural style of the park, characterized by organic forms and bold color contrasts. The architecture is dominantly cream and brown, with whimsical, undulating structures that resemble a living, breathing landscape. The trees and vegetation are minimal, designed to complement the sculptural designs rather than compete with them. The sculptures resembling animal faces add a touch of fantasy to the setting. A clear blue sky provides a vibrant backdrop. Amidst these fantastical elements, visitors can be seen walking along the pathways, enjoying the surreal environment that is so distinctly Gaudí. The light appears to be that of late afternoon, casting soft shadows and giving the scene a warm glow.
