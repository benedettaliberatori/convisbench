The video frames present a tutorial for creating an Egyptian hijab with a side pleat. Each frame features a woman positioned slightly off-center holding her hijab, a light pink garment, while her appearance remains constant against a pure white background. The woman is possibly demonstrating a technique or providing instructions. The text overlay suggests the video is about cutting and sewing techniques. Throughout the frames, the focus remains on the technique and the final product is not visible.
