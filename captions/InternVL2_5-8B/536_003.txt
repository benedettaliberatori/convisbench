The scene takes place outdoors, likely on a pier or in a boat on a body of water, given the presence of water in the background and the voice-over mentioning 'water' and 'wind.' The lighting suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon. The person is wearing a light-colored long-sleeve shirt, a life jacket, and a cap. They are holding a fishing rod and reeling in a fish with a shiny, elongated body and yellow-green coloration. The fish appears to be a flounder, as mentioned in the video title. The person comments that 'fishing is finally coming right now,' as they reel it in and mention the effectiveness of the 'hollow bug,' which is probably the type of bait being used. The water is calm, and there's no visible wind. In the background, there are small yellow buoys floating on the water.
