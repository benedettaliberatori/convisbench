In a well-lit, clean kitchen, a person is shown preparing a skillet for cooking on a countertop. The individual is wearing a casual shirt and baseball cap. They hold a clear bowl of melted butter from which they pour a generous amount onto the preheated skillet. As they spread the butter around it with a basting brush, the sizzling sound indicates the skillet is hot. The ingredients are placed on a clean white marble counter, with the skillet situated directly on it. The kitchen's background features various cooking utensils, jars, and a sign that reads 'FARM' visible through what appears to be a window into another room. The butter's light yellow color contrasts sharply with the black non-stick skillet and the white countertop.
