In a greenhouse environment, a person is seen preparing two plants for propagation. The first plant is already encased in a plastic bottle for rooting. The individual's hand carefully positions a second, taller plant into a similar clear plastic bottle that is lying horizontally on top of small pots filled with soil and pebbles. A large watering can is present, suggesting recent watering or preparation for it. The soil appears moist and well-draining, indicative of a favorable growing medium. There is a water bottle labeled'master' in the background, which suggests either irrigation readiness or use as a measuring tool. The hand is steady, indicating experience or familiarity with the process. Both plants have green foliage, and there is natural light suggesting daytime, possibly morning due to the softness. The setting looks like a domestic gardening setup, simple but equipped for plant care.
