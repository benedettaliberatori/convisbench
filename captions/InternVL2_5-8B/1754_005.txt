A person is demonstrating a haircutting technique with long chestnut hair. They start by cutting a section of hair at its end, applying pressure with one hand as the other hand manipulates the scissors. The focus is on clean, straight cuts, maintaining the full length. The person's hands are visible, using a comb to section the hair, ensuring consistency. It's an indoor environment with a plain white background that highlights the hair and hands at work. The comb is red and makes a contrast with the dark hair. The cutting is precise, suggesting experience in the craft, aimed at achieving layered hair cuts that offer full length. Natural light reflects off the hair, indicating a well-lit setting ideal for detailing.
