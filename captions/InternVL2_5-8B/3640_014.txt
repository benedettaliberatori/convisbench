In a home kitchen setting, a person is preparing instant noodles, specifically Zongzi noodles, presumably from a restaurant brand given the mention of 'Zongzi' in the video title. The video showcases a single person's hands as they add blocks of yellow-colored noodles into a pot of water, which is boiling vigorously. The pot is on a stovetop with an orange-red sauce simmering in a separate pan beside it. The person then uses a black slotted spoon to transfer the noodles from the pot to a light green bowl. The kitchen has various cooking implements and ingredients visible but focused on the noodle preparation. Lighting is natural and warm, suggesting daytime. The predominant colors are the yellow of the noodles, the silver pot, and the green bowl, complemented by the background's neutral kitchen tones.
