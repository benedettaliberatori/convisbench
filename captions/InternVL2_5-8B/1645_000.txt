A person stands on a black mat in a gym, wearing a grey t-shirt and black pants. They perform an exercise routine using resistance bands. The individual is holding the black bands attached to sturdy anchors on the floor, ensuring stability. The gym environment is filled with various exercise equipment, including dumbbells, barbells, and a squat rack in the background. It's well-lit, likely with fluorescent lighting, highlighting the orange walls and the grey-glossy floor. The person's movements are deliberate and controlled as they bend forward at the waist while keeping their core and legs engaged. They alternate legs, performing what appears to be a side-to-side push-off motion against the band resistance, possibly working on lower body strength and mobility.
