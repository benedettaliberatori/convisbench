The scene unfolds outdoors, likely on a patio or backyard terrace, where a person is preparing food for a Sushi Roll. They are wearing a blue t-shirt and black gloves to ensure cleanliness when handling food. On a wooden chopping board, they are slicing red tomatoes and red onions using a large chef's knife. The knife has a patterned blade and a natural wood handle, emphasizing the homemade nature of the preparation. We see bowls with ingredients like onions, tomatoes, and possibly other components, indicating the beginning stages of food assembly for a dish that requires precise cutting as seen in the voice-over's instruction to cut every ingredient in half for even distribution. The lighting is natural and bright, suggesting daytime. There are bottles of sauces or condiments on the table, adding to the culinary setting. A bag of sushi rice and other typical sushi roll ingredients are also present, setting up the context for this preparation.
