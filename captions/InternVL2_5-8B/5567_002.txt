Two individuals stand in front of a backdrop adorned with multiple durians on shelves. The person on the left wears a red and black plaid shirt, while the individual on the right dons a black polo with a small logo on the left chest and grey gloves. They engage in a conversation about selling durians, discussing their personal start, experiences, and how they aim to sell durians quality. The environment is an indoor setting with artificial lighting that highlights the subjects and the durians' details. The person on the right gestures to emphasize points about their journey and education on selecting durians. The scene is informal, with an instructional or personal anecdotal atmosphere. The colors are vibrant, with green durians providing a contrast against the neutral backdrop.
