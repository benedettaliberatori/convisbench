A person is coating a cooked corn cob with a white substance from a bowl, possibly mayonnaise or sauce. They're wearing a black shirt with a small logo, black gloves, and a camouflage baseball cap. The background is a kitchen setting with a sign saying 'TIE THE TIES, GET THE RISE', hints of kitchenware, and a globe. The person uses a brush with light green bristles, possibly for spreading. The corn is bright yellow, suggesting it's well-cooked. The bowl appears to be metallic. The table is wooden. No additional characters are visible in the frame.
