A person is working on a kitchen countertop, preparing a dough that requires glazing. The countertop is a smooth, light-colored marble that reflects the light from above, emphasizing the subject's actions. The person, wearing a gray long-sleeved shirt, uses a spoon to pour a golden egg wash onto the dough, a technique known as glazing, which adds an appealing shine to the baked good upon cooking. The dough is spread out in the center and has a creamy white base, possibly indicating it's already rolled or flattened. To the side, partially out of frame, there appears to be a utensil, possibly a dough scraper or rolling pin. The kitchen has a modern look with a dark backsplash, suggesting a contemporary setting. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the glossy texture of the egg wash and emphasizing the work area's cleanliness.
