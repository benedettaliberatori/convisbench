The scene takes place in a kitchen, likely on a countertop given the backdrop of white and light-colored tiles. A person wearing black rubber gloves is preparing a large, raw tomahawk steak for cooking. They begin by peeling off a small piece of plastic wrap from the steak's surface. Next, they season the surface liberally with salt. The environment seems well-lit, probably using natural or kitchen lighting, highlighting the glistening meat and the black gloves. The salad oil used is identifiable by the brand 'Bertolli,' a green bottle with red and white labels, which is poured over the steak to coat it thoroughly. The seasonings and spices present include 'McNamee's Ground Peppercorn,' garlic powder, and what appears to be an Italian seasoning mix in a spice jar with red labels. The meat's rich red color suggests its freshness and high quality, emphasized by the luxurious presentation of the steak on a white plate.
