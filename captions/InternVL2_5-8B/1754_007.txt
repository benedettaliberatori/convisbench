The clip features a detailed hair styling session on a mannequin head. Initially, the hair is parted down the middle. The stylist, wearing a black shirt, uses a comb and scissors to make precise adjustments, ensuring the cut aligns with the split section. His hands are steady as he trims around existing bobs and layers, with a focus on symmetry and evenness. The camera angle is close-up, highlighting the technique. He then fluffs and arranges the hair naturally, letting it fall back into place, which appears wet and shiny under even lighting conditions. The hair is a rich brown color. Finally, the stylist uses a round brush and hairdryer for blow-drying, creating body in the hair. Throughout this process, the hands are well-detailed, showcasing skillful manipulation of the product.
