The scene takes place outdoors, likely in a forest due to the wood and foliage in the background. The main focus is on a person's hands as they work on a piece of metal. Initially, sparks fly as the person scrapes metal against another object, suggesting the use of a sharpening stone or a whetstone. This is indicated by the voice-over saying 'Олить', a verb in Russian meaning'sharpen'. Subsequently, the person uses an electric tool, possibly a grinder, for more precise sharpening. This is visually confirmed by the voice-over stating 'Граб-сталек', likely referring to a 'growl' stalker, a term for a device used to cut or grind materials. The metal being sharpened is silver-colored, held between the thumb and fingers of the person. The surrounding area appears rough and worn, consistent with an outdoor setting.
