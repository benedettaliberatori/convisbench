The voice-over in the video describes using oregano tea as a natural shampoo, conditioner, and mouth wash. The first frame shows hands stirring fresh oregano infused in boiling water on a kitchen stove. The pot appears colorful, implying a mixture of green herbs in the water. In the subsequent frames, the hands pour the oregano tea into a mason jar, suggesting storage for future use. Another jar possibly contains the same tea. The scene then shifts to a display of multiple similar jars, likely filled with the same infused tea, arranged neatly, indicating it might be a process of making multiple servings at once. The environment is a home kitchen setting with a focus on natural ingredient preparation for hair and oral health care. The colors are warm and earthy with the green of the oregano contrasting against the clear glass and brown jars.
