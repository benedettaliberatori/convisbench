A woman is seen performing an exercise routine on the beach. She's wearing a light blue sports bra and shorts, complemented by sneakers. The exercise involves a plank position followed by lowering and retracting the back knee towards the opposite elbow, alternating sides with fluid motion. The background reveals a sunny beach scene with waves gently crashing on the shore, a few scattered rocks, and a modern beachfront house. The sky is clear, suggesting it's a bright, sunny day perfect for outdoor activities. The woman has a focused expression, emphasizing the intensity of the workout. The yoga mat she uses is pink and purple, contrasting with the sandy tones of the beach. In the upper right corner, there's a counter displaying 'EXERCISE 9/10' and a countdown timer starting from 30 seconds.
