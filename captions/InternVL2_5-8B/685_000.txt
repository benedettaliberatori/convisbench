The video is set in a well-equipped home garage gym with black and white decor, featuring various exercise machines and weights. A man in a black cap, T-shirt, and pants stands on one side of a foam roller placed on the ground. A woman, in a sleeveless top and shorts with a bandage on her knee, leans onto the foam roller with her arms on her hips in a kneeling position. The gym's flooring is black, and there's an American flag and a Captain America shield as wall decorations. A black weight bench takes center stage, and an exercise bike and dumbbells are visible in the background. The lighting is bright, suggesting daylight or overhead lights. The room looks neatly organized, reflecting a serious workout environment.
