In a domestic kitchen setting with a neutral color palette, a person's hands, wearing a grey shirt and a watch on their left wrist, are shown in a series of close-up frames. They are interacting with strawberries that are placed on a white paper spread across the countertop. In the second frame, the individual holds a cut strawberry, showcasing its freshness and color. There is a stainless steel kitchen knife lying nearby. Moving on, a bottle of juice is poured into a small plastic container containing mashed strawberries, creating a vibrant red juice mixture. The hand gently presses down the liquid mixture in the container, which appears to be a DIY strawberry drink recipe preparation. The environment is well-lit, suggesting natural daylight might be coming from outside the frame.
