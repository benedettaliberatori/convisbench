The scene takes place on a sandy beach under a clear blue sky. A man in a bright lime green jacket and black cap is seen preparing for tandem kite surfing. He's wearing a harness system with safety ropes and is holding onto what appears to be a kite control bar or handle assembly. The man is speaking about his preference for having no handles on his kite surfing gear to maintain speed while maneuvering. A parachute is partially visible on the ground beside him, suggesting he's either gearing up for or finishing kite surfing. The beach is relatively empty, with few vehicles visible in the distance, indicating it might be a less busy time or location. The colors are vibrant with the contrasting sky blue and sandy hues of the beach.
