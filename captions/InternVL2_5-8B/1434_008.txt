In a kitchen setting, a stainless steel non-stick frying pan sits on a gas stove. It appears to be preheated with minimal oil, as evidenced by slight sparkling at the bottom of the pan, indicating it's hot. A person's hand is seen cracking a single egg from a bright yellow eggshell into the pan, revealing a raw egg with a intact yolk at its center. Following this, they sprinkle cumin seeds and salt onto the egg, indicating a flavor enhancement. The person then uses a pair of tongs to flip the egg, cooking it over medium heat. The hand movements are intentional and careful to ensure even cooking of the egg white and yolk. The environment suggests a home cooking or small professional kitchen with focused lighting highlighting the frying action.
