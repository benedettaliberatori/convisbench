In a kitchen with a marble countertop, a person wearing a grey long-sleeve shirt is seen preparing dough. They're working with a large piece of dough that has been rolled out flat. The dough is lightly sprinkled with flour, creating a dusting that gives it a textured appearance. In their hand, there's a rolling pin which they use to gently press and roll the dough toward them, starting to form a cylindrical shape. In the background, there's a bowl with yellow contents, possibly egg wash or cream, next to a wooden spatula resting on the side. The rolling and shaping actions are methodical and repetitive as the person creates the base of what seems to be a layered pastry or dessert, indicated by the methodical application of what appears to be cinnamon sugar to the top of the dough.
