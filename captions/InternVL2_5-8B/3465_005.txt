The clip opens with a close view of a seasoned, speckled black pan with a non-stick coating, sitting on a gas stove with four burners visible. It's placed in an older model kitchen, evident from the style and appliances. A hand enters the frame holding a spoon, scooping clear, golden vegetable oil. The hand of a person who is presumably the cook is shown but not much else. They pour exactly two tablespoons of oil into the pan. The oil spreads as it's added, covering the bottom of the pan uniformly. The cook is likely starting the prep for cooking something, possibly a 'chakki ki sabzi' as indicated by the video's title, and the sound of sizzling may soon follow. The environment is homely and suggests everyday dish preparation.
