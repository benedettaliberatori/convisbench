In a well-lit, spacious gym with various exercise equipment, a person in dark-colored hoodie and shorts is lying on a red bench, performing triceps dips by pushing up with oneâ€™s arms. A spotter stands behind to ensure their safety by holding the bench. The individual is focused and exerting effort, with weights visible on the bar in front of them. Their clothing contrasts the equipment around, and the gym's clean floors and organized space reflect professional use. No distinctive marks or texts are discernible except for what is described. The scene has an instructional or motivational tone, indicated by the phrase '19 REPS!' present in one frame.
