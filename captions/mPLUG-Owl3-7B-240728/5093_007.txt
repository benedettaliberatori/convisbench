The video shows a man in a grey shirt and cap demonstrating how to make a red velvet cake. He starts by cutting a red velvet cake into a red heart shape and then proceeds to frost it with white cream. He then uses a knife to cut the cake into a square shape and cuts it into smaller pieces. The video ends with the man talking to the camera.
