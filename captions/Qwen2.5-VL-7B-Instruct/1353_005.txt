A cricket bowler, dressed in a green and blue Pakistan cricket uniform with the word "Pakistan" printed across the chest, is delivering a ball to a batsman wearing a white helmet with black trim. The wicketkeeper in blue gear and the non-striking batsman in yellow gear are crouched behind the stumps, ready to play. The bowler steps back from the crease, releases the ball, and it travels towards the batsman.

The scene shifts to the batsman, wearing a full protective helmet, gloves, and a bat, who is standing in front of the stumps, preparing to play the shot. He raises his left hand, likely indicating he's attempting a single or four run shot, while the non-striking batsman keeps his hand down on the ground. The wicketkeeper and the non-striker move closer to the wicket as the ball approaches.

The camera then focuses on the wicketkeeper, dressed in a blue and black uniform, who crouches low over the stumps. The wicketkeeper catches the ball cleanly between the off and slip stumps, causing the batsman to be run out. The wicketkeeper celebrates by raising both hands in triumph, while the non-striker throws his hands in the air in celebration.
