A person is washing a piece of meat under running water in a stainless steel sink. The meat appears to be a steak or a similar cut, and it is being rinsed thoroughly to remove any impurities or excess blood. The person's hands are visible, holding the meat steady as they rinse it. The sink has a single basin with a drain at the bottom, and there is a yellow sponge on the edge of the sink. The water is clear and flows from a faucet above the sink. The scene is set in a kitchen environment.
