A gloved hand holds a tree branch steady while another hand uses a knife to cut it. The knife is held at an angle, and the blade is inserted into the bark of the branch. The hand holding the branch applies pressure to keep it from moving. The knife cuts through the bark, creating a clean cut. The hand then lifts the branch away from the tree trunk.
