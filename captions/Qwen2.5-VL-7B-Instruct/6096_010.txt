The video starts with a close-up shot of a wooden cutting board on a wooden table. A person wearing a floral apron is preparing a pie crust. They hold a metal sieve filled with sliced apples and sprinkle the flour into the sieve before pouring it onto the pie dough. The person then begins to mix the flour into the pie crust, using their hands to work the dough together. They continue to mix until the dough is evenly spread. Once the dough is prepared, they place the sliced apples on top of it.
