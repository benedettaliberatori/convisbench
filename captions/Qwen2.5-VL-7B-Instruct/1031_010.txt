The video starts with a person in a black jacket holding a fish in a shallow stream. They are crouching down in the water, and their back is to the camera. The person then stands up and points towards the camera, gesturing with their hands as they speak. The camera then cuts to a man in camouflage pants standing in the water, holding a fishing rod. He is also wearing a black jacket and a black cap. He appears to be talking to someone off-camera. The camera then pans to show the man holding the fish, which is now on a leash. The man is smiling and speaking to the person who is filming him. The video ends with the man holding the fish up in front of the camera.
