A man and a woman stand on a blue mat in a gymnastics gym. The man is wearing a grey sweatshirt and black shorts, while the woman is wearing a grey hoodie and black pants. They both look at each other and smile. The man then begins to run across the mat, doing a round-off back handspring tuck. He lands smoothly on his feet. The man and the woman then walk away from the camera.
