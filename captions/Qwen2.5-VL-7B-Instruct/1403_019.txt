A group of people are fishing on rocks along the shoreline of a large body of water. The sky is overcast and the water is choppy, with waves crashing onto the rocks. The people are standing on the rocks, holding fishing rods and reeling in their lines. One person is seen casting his line into the water. Another person is seen reeling in a fish that has been caught. The fish appears to be a large, white-colored fish. A man is seen holding up the fish, showing it off to the camera. He is wearing a red and black shirt and black shorts. He is also wearing a black baseball cap.
