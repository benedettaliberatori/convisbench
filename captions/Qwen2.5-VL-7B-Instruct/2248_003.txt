The video is a point of view shot from someone using a metal detector on the beach. The camera is facing downwards, showing the person's feet as they walk through the water and sand. The metal detector is held in the person's right hand and is pointed towards the ground. The screen on the metal detector shows a digital readout that fluctuates as the person moves the detector over the ground. The sound of the water splashing against the shore can be heard in the background. The person is walking at a steady pace, their feet sinking slightly into the sand and water as they move forward.
