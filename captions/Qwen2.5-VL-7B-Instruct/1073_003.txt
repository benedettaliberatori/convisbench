A bartender dressed in a white shirt and blue vest with a bow tie is preparing a cocktail in a modern kitchen setting. He starts by pouring 60 ml of Martini Rosato from a bottle into a martini glass on a bar top. The background features various ingredients and appliances, including a bowl of fruits, a bottle of Prosecco, and a microwave. The bartender then adds 45 ml of Fever-Tree Soda Water to the glass, followed by another 60 ml of Prosecco. He stirs the mixture with a wooden spoon and garnishes the drink with a slice of grapefruit and two slices of strawberry.
