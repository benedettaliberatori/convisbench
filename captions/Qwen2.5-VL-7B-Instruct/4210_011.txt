A person wearing black gloves is cutting a piece of meat on a wooden cutting board. The meat appears to be cooked and has a dark, charred exterior. The person uses a knife to slice the meat into smaller pieces. The camera focuses on the cutting process, showing the texture and color of the meat as it is being sliced. The person then holds up a piece of the sliced meat for the camera to see.
