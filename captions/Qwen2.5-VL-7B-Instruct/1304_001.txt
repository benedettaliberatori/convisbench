The video begins with a wide shot of the back of a blue car parked on a paved road near a beach. The trunk is open, revealing a large pile of items inside, including a white blanket, a pink backpack, and some other clothing items. The scene then cuts to a close-up view of the back seat, where the same white blanket is seen being folded or adjusted. The camera focuses on the texture and color of the blanket, capturing its folds and the way it is being handled. The sequence ends with the car still parked on the road near the beach, but the focus is on the back seat and the blanket.
