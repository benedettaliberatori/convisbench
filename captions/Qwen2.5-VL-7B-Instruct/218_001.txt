The video begins with a close-up shot of a person's hand holding a fishing rod, which is pointed towards the water. The camera then pans up to show the fishing rod and reel in more detail. The person is wearing gloves and is holding the fishing rod steady as they cast it into the water. As the fishing rod is cast, the camera follows the line as it travels through the air and into the water. After a few seconds, the fishing line disappears into the water and the person lets the fishing rod go slack. The video ends with a shot of the person's gloved hand reaching out of the water.
