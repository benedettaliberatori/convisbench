A close-up of a pink crocheted pattern is shown, with a crochet hook inserted into the fabric. The hook is black and is being used to pull yarn through the loops. The yarn is a soft pink color and appears to be made of a cotton aran material. The crochet hook is being used to create a pattern that consists of a series of interlocking loops. The crochet hook is being held by a hand that is not visible in the frame. The crochet hook is being moved in a back and forth motion, pulling the yarn through the loops to create the pattern.
