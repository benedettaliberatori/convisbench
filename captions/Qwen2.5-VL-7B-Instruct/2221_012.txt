The video depicts a cooking scene where someone is preparing to cook something on a stovetop. The main focus is on a black non-stick frying pan placed on a black stovetop with a digital display showing the temperature at 50 degrees Celsius. 

In the background, there is a yellow sponge and a white container, possibly containing oil or another cooking ingredient. A hand enters the frame from the right side, holding a small glass measuring cup filled with a liquid, likely oil or butter. The hand then pours the liquid into the frying pan.

The lighting in the scene is dim, creating a cozy and intimate atmosphere. The overall setting suggests a home kitchen environment where someone is about to start cooking a meal.
