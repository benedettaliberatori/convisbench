A hand cracks an egg into a hot frying pan, the yolk and white splattering slightly as they hit the surface. The hand then uses a fork to gently stir the egg, ensuring it cooks evenly. The camera focuses on the egg as it begins to set, with the white becoming opaque and the yolk remaining bright orange. The hand then sprinkles salt and pepper over the egg, adding seasoning to the cooking process. Finally, the hand uses a spatula to lift the cooked egg from the pan, revealing a perfectly cooked sunny-side-up egg with a runny yolk.
