A shirtless man is performing jump squats outdoors on a paved surface. He starts by squatting down, keeping his knees behind his toes and his chest up. As he reaches the bottom of the movement, he rapidly rises to his feet, completing the jump. He then repeats the movement several times. The camera follows him as he performs the exercise. A second man stands nearby, watching and occasionally gesturing with his hands.
