A man in a bright yellow jacket and black cap stands on a sandy beach, holding a large kite with multiple strings attached to it. He is wearing a harness and appears to be preparing to fly the kite. The sky is clear and blue, and there are a few boats visible in the distance on the water. The man is pointing towards the direction he wants to fly the kite, and he seems to be explaining something about the kite or the process of flying it.
