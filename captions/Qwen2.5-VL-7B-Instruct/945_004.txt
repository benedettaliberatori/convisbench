The video begins with a close-up shot of a wooden spoon stirring a mixture of chopped nuts and seeds in a large bowl. The camera then pans down to show the bowl being placed on a white plate. Next, the camera focuses on a hand holding a small red and white striped cloth, which is used to wipe the edge of the bowl. Finally, the camera shows the bowl being filled with a brown substance, likely a type of flour or powder.
