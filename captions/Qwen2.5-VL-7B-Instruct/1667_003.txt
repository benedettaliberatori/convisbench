The video features two female tennis players, Martic and Jankovic, competing in a match on an indoor hard court. The scene begins with a wide shot of the court, showing the players in action. The scoreboard indicates that Martic is leading 7-6, 2-0. The players are both wearing white tops and blue shorts. As the game progresses, one of the players falls to the ground, possibly after making a mistake in her serve or during a rally. She immediately gets up, looking visibly frustrated, and begins to walk away from the court in anger. The audience watches in disbelief as she retreats off the court. Another player joins her, also appearing upset. The video ends with the players walking back onto the court, clearly frustrated by the loss.
