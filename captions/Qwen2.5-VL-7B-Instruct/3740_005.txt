The video begins with a close-up shot of a cast iron skillet on a stovetop, which is being heated. The camera then pans to show the skillet with oil being poured into it. Next, pieces of meat are added to the skillet and cooked until they are browned on both sides. The meat is then removed from the skillet using tongs.
