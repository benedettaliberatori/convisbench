The video begins with a close-up shot of a person's feet walking on a rocky beach, with the camera then moving underwater to show a small fish swimming near some rocks. The camera then pans up to reveal a person wearing a scuba mask and snorkel, holding a small object in their hand. The camera then moves back down to the rocks, showing a small crab crawling along the rocks. The camera then moves back up to the surface of the water, where the person is seen swimming towards the camera. The video ends with the person taking a selfie while still underwater.
