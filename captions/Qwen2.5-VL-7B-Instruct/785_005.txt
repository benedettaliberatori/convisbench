A bartender, dressed in a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves, stands behind the bar. The bar is stocked with various bottles of alcohol and other beverages, including a bottle of Aperol, a bottle of Rekordlager, and three red glasses. The bartender is adding a dark liquid from a shaker into one of the red glasses using a spoon. The background features shelves lined with bottles and glasses, as well as an orange fruit on a wooden cutting board. The scene appears to be set in a well-lit bar or kitchen.
