In the image, there is a person performing a side plank exercise on a pink mat. The individual is wearing an orange tank top with a graphic design and dark pants. Their arms are straight and placed under their body, supporting them in the plank position. The words "SIDE PLANK" and "3 SETS TILL FAILURE" are prominently displayed in white text across the screen, indicating that the workout involves three sets of the side plank until failure. The background shows a gym setting with various fitness equipment, including weight machines, benches, and water bottles stacked against the wall. The lighting is bright, and the overall environment appears to be well-lit and organized for a workout session.
