A mountain biker is riding through a dense forest, navigating a series of challenging obstacles. The rider is wearing a black helmet and a black jacket, and the bike is equipped with knobby tires for better traction on the uneven terrain. The biker skillfully maneuvers around a fallen tree, then continues down a steep incline, kicking up dust as they descend. They then ride over a small hill, maintaining balance as they approach a rocky outcropping. The biker then descends a steep drop, their bike tilting as they navigate the rocky path. Finally, the biker rides through a tunnel formed by trees, their speed increasing as they emerge into an open field.
