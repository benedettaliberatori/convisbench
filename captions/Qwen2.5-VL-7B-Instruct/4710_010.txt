The video captures the beginning stages of cooking. A person's hand is seen pouring butter into a stainless steel skillet on a gas stove. The skillet sits on a burner, and there are visible flames underneath it. The butter is placed in the center of the pan and starts to melt, creating small bubbles around it. To the right of the skillet, there is a strainer with what appears to be cooked rice or another yellowish food item. In the background, there are various kitchen utensils and a marble countertop, including a wooden spoon and a whisk. The overall scene suggests that someone is preparing a dish that involves melting butter as part of the cooking process.
