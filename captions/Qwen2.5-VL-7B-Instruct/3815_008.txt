A man is fishing on a boat in the ocean. He is wearing a black jacket and a baseball cap. He is holding a fishing rod and is reeling it in. The ocean is rough and choppy. There is another person on the boat who is also fishing. They are both looking out at the ocean and trying to catch fish. The man is reeling in his line and is smiling. There is a bird flying over the water.
