A young man is practicing juggling with two swords in a grassy field. He is wearing a blue shirt, black pants, and colorful socks. The swords are held in his hands and he is juggling them by throwing one sword to his left and catching it with his right hand. He then throws the other sword to his right and catches it with his left hand. He repeats this motion several times.
