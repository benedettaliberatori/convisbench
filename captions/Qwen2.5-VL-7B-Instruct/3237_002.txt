A beekeeper wearing a white beekeeping suit and hat, gloves, and a veil, uses a hive tool to gently remove a small section of the honeycomb from a beehive. The beehive is on the ground next to a building with a sign that reads "Almond Grove Crafts." The beekeeper carefully handles the comb, which is covered in bees, using the tool. He then places the comb into a box.
