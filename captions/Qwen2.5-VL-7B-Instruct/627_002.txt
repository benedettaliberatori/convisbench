A man in a yellow shirt and black pants stands on a balance board, carefully balancing himself as he adjusts his weight. The camera then cuts to a close-up of a person's feet standing on the balance board, wearing black shoes and gray sweatpants with white stripes. The person practices tipping in various ways, shifting their weight from side to side and adjusting their stance.
