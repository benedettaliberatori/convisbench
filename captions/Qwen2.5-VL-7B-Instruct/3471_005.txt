A man in a green and white striped shirt and a white hat is pouring a liquid from a white measuring cup into a red funnel that is placed over a metal pot. The liquid appears to be yellowish in color, possibly a type of oil or cooking oil. The man is smiling and seems to be enjoying the process of pouring the liquid. The background shows an outdoor area with a wooden table and a potted plant.
