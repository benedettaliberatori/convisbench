A man is standing in a dance studio, wearing a blue shirt and black shorts. He is demonstrating a dance move called "Elbow to Knee." He starts by placing his left hand on his left knee and then raises his right leg up to his right elbow. He repeats this move with his right hand on his right knee and his left leg raised to his left elbow. The video is part of a 7 Minute Morning workout routine.
