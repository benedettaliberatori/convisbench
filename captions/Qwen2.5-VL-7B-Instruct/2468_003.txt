A man is practicing throwing a discus in an indoor track and field facility. He is standing on a platform with his feet together, holding the discus in his right hand. He steps forward with his left foot, bringing the discus up high above his head as he prepares to throw it. He throws the discus with a powerful motion, sending it flying through the air. He then runs across the track, following the discus with his eyes as it travels. He finishes by raising his arms in the air in celebration of his throw.
