A woman is practicing yoga on a sandy beach. She is dressed in an orange sports bra and gray leggings, and her hair is tied back. She is sitting on a beige mat with her legs extended in front of her, and she is reaching forward towards the ground. The text "5. Forward Fold" is displayed at the bottom of the screen. The woman is performing a yoga pose that stretches the front of the body, particularly the hamstrings and calves. The background shows a clear sky, the ocean waves crashing onto the shore, and a pier in the distance. There are a few people walking along the beach in the background. The camera remains focused on the woman as she performs the pose.
