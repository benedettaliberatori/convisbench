A young woman is performing a split on a pink and purple yoga mat. She is wearing a black tank top and black leggings. She starts by bending her knees and bringing her feet together, then she extends her legs straight out in front of her. She then splits her legs to the sides, keeping her feet together. She holds the split for five seconds, then slowly lowers herself back to the mat. The video is shot in a living room with a fish tank and a potted plant in the background.
