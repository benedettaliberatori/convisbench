The video begins with a close-up of several terracotta pots of varying sizes and shapes, including some plastic pots. The camera then focuses on a hand wearing a white glove as it uses a blue spatula to transfer soil from a blue bucket into one of the pots. The scene transitions to a close-up of a cactus, which is being dusted off with a white cloth. The cactus has a fuzzy texture and is covered in small white particles. The video ends with a close-up of the cactus's spines.
