The video starts with a shot of a man standing outside at a table, preparing food. He is wearing a blue shirt and has a black mohawk hairstyle. In front of him on the table are various ingredients, including a bag of sushi rice, a bottle of soy sauce, and a bottle of sesame oil. There are also a cutting board, a knife, and some vegetables on the table.

Next, the camera focuses on the man's hands as he begins to cut the vegetables. He is wearing black gloves and uses a sharp knife to slice the vegetables into small pieces. The vegetables he is cutting include carrots, tomatoes, and radishes. The camera then zooms out to show the entire table, which is covered with a variety of ingredients.

Finally, the camera shows the man holding a bowl of sliced vegetables. He is still wearing his black gloves and appears to be preparing the vegetables for cooking. The video ends with a close-up shot of the bowl of sliced vegetables.
