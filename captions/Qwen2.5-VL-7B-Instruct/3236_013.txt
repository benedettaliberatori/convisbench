Two men are cooking beignets in a kitchen. One man is holding a bag of powdered sugar and the other is using a spatula to flip the beignets in a pan. The beignets are golden brown and have a crispy exterior. The man with the bag of powdered sugar sprinkles it on top of the beignets. The kitchen has stainless steel appliances and a backsplash with a geometric pattern.
