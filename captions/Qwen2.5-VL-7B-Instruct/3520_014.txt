A woman in workout attire is demonstrating the "Side Plank Hip Raise" exercise on a yoga mat. She begins by lying on her side with her left arm extended straight and her right leg raised off the ground, holding a plank position. She then raises her hips up towards the ceiling while keeping her core engaged and her body in a straight line from head to heels. The video provides tips on how to perform the exercise correctly, emphasizing the importance of keeping the core engaged and the body in a straight line. The video also includes a countdown timer that gradually decreases from 26 seconds to 6 seconds, as well as an image of the next exercise that will follow, which is a side plank hold. The woman's movements are deliberate and controlled, and she maintains a steady pace throughout the demonstration. The background is a white room with a few potted plants, providing a clean and minimalist look.
