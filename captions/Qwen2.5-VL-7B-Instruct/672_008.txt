A person wearing white gloves is shown making a chocolate dessert. They use a metal spatula to spread a thick, dark chocolate mixture evenly across the bottom of a rectangular glass baking dish. The person then uses their fingers to press down on the mixture, creating an indentation that will be used for dividing the dessert into smaller portions. The person then uses the spatula again to smooth out the mixture and create even lines where the dessert will be divided.
