A young boy stands in a kitchen, wearing glasses and a blue shirt with white stripes. He holds a plate of raw chicken breasts in one hand and uses tongs to place them into a large red skillet filled with oil on the stove. The kitchen is well-lit with wooden cabinets, a microwave, and various kitchen items on the counter. A text overlay reads "GARLIC CLOVES 4 TO 5," indicating a recipe step involving garlic.
