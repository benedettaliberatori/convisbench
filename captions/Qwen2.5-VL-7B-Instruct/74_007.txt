A digital character stands in a grassy park area with a clear blue sky above. The character is dressed in a black tank top and black leggings, with their hair tied back. Palm trees and a yellow school bus are visible in the background, indicating an urban setting. The character begins by stepping sideways, performing lateral hops. They then transition into jump squats, squatting down and pushing off to rise back up. The character repeats these movements several times. The scene transitions to a dark screen before fading into another set of exercises, specifically "LATERAL HOPs to BALANCE."
