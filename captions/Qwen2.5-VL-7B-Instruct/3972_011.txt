The video begins with a man standing on a grassy hillside, next to a green tent. He is holding a hiking pole and appears to be preparing for a hike. As he begins to walk away from the camera, he smiles and speaks into his phone, likely checking his GPS or communicating with someone. The camera follows him as he continues to walk up the hill. As the sun sets, the sky turns a beautiful orange and purple hue. The man reaches the top of the hill and sits down in front of his tent, looking out over the landscape. He then lights a fire in the tent and settles in for the night. The video ends with the sound of the wind blowing through the trees at the base of the hill.
