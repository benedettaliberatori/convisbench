A young man wearing a gray t-shirt and a black baseball cap is standing in a kitchen. He is holding a carrot in his right hand and is about to eat it. He takes a bite of the carrot and then looks at the camera with a smile on his face. He then puts the carrot down and picks up a glass bowl. He holds the bowl up to the camera and smiles.
