The video shows a close-up of a vintage camera, specifically a Cosina Hi-Lite DLE model. The camera is placed on a flat surface, and two hands are visible, one on each side of the camera. The left hand holds the top of the camera steady while the right hand inserts a roll of 35mm film into the camera's back. The film is carefully aligned with the film leader and pushed into place. After inserting the film, the right hand then removes the film cartridge from the camera, revealing the exposed film inside. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, and there are no other objects or movements in the frame.
