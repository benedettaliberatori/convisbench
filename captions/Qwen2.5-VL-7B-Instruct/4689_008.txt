The video shows a close-up of a black non-stick pan on a stove. A person's hand, with blue nail polish, pours melted butter into the pan from another container. The butter begins to melt and spread across the surface of the pan. The pan is then stirred with a wooden spoon, causing the butter to bubble and cook. The scene is set in a kitchen with a tiled backsplash visible in the background.
