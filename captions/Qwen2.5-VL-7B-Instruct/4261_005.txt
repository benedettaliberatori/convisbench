A cyclist is riding down a residential street on a sunny day. The cyclist, dressed in a yellow jacket and black helmet, rides past a stop sign on the left side of the frame. The street is lined with parked cars on both sides and houses in the background. The cyclist continues straight ahead as the camera follows them from behind.
