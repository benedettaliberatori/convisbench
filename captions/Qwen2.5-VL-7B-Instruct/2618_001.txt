The video begins with a close-up shot of a tree trunk, where a person wearing blue gloves is using a tool to cut into the bark. The camera then shifts to show the sap flowing out as the tool is removed from the tree. The sap is collected in a container. The video ends with a shot of the sap being poured into a pot.
