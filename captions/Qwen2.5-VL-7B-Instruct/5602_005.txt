The video shows a cooking process where chopped onions and diced ham are being saut√©ed in a stainless steel pot on a stovetop. The onions are translucent, indicating they have been cooking for some time, while the ham pieces are pinkish-red, suggesting they are still raw or partially cooked. A hand is seen adding minced garlic from a yellow container into the pot, which is likely to enhance the flavor of the dish. The garlic is finely chopped and appears to be freshly minced. The pot is placed on a burner, and the heat is visible as the ingredients sizzle and cook. The background is slightly blurred, focusing attention on the cooking process.
