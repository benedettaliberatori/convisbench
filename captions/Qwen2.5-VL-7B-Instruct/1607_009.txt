A young woman is practicing yoga on the beach. She is wearing a light blue sports bra and matching leggings. She is performing a handstand pose, with her hands on the mat and her feet in the air. The ocean is visible in the background, with waves crashing onto the shore. There is a clock in the top right corner of the screen, showing that she has been practicing for 2 minutes and 13 seconds.
