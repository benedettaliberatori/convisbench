The video starts with a close-up of a hand holding a smartphone, likely filming the scene. The background reveals an outdoor setting, where a black bicycle is locked to a railing. The camera then pans to the right, showing more of the bicycle and the surrounding area. The bicycle has blue and yellow components. The person filming is wearing a light-colored shirt with a pattern and has a tattoo on their left arm. The environment appears to be a residential area with multi-story buildings visible in the background. The weather seems clear, as there is natural light illuminating the scene.
