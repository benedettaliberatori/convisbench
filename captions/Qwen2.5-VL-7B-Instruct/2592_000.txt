The video begins with a title card that reads "ACLIM8" and "CAMPING SURVIVAL HOW TO BUILD A FIRE." The camera then zooms in on a pile of branches and twigs, which have already caught fire. The flames are bright orange and yellow, with some sparks flying off the embers. The branches and twigs are arranged in a teepee shape, with the largest branch at the bottom and smaller branches stacked on top. The video ends with a close-up shot of the flames and embers.
