A football game is unfolding on the field, with players in blue and white uniforms indicating they are from the Oklahoma team, and those in red and gold from the Kansas team. The play appears to be in the second quarter with nine minutes and five seconds left on the clock. The scoreboard shows Kansas leading at 10-9 with 7:58 remaining, while Oklahoma has 6 points.

The quarterback of the Kansas team is preparing for an automatic snap, which indicates that the defensive players are not engaged. A pass is thrown downfield as the offensive line attempts to block, but the receiver catches the ball without being tackled. This action suggests that the Kansas team is trying to establish a first down.

The environment is filled with spectators, adding to the atmosphere typical of a live football game. The field features the prominent "OKLAHOMA" logo, and the game is broadcasted by FOX on the Fox Sports Network. The play seems tactical, aiming to advance the ball quickly and potentially score more points for their team.
