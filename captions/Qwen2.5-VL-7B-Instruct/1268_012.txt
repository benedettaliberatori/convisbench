A woman in a green shirt stands at a kitchen counter, preparing cauliflower for roasting. She begins by cutting the cauliflower into florets on a wooden cutting board. Next, she places the florets on a baking sheet. She then pours 1 tablespoon of avocado oil over the cauliflower, spreading it evenly with her hand. After that, she adds 1 teaspoon of porcini powder to a small bowl and carefully sprinkles it over the cauliflower on the baking sheet. She repeats this process, adding another teaspoon of porcini powder. Finally, she adds 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of fresh black pepper to the mixture, again using a small bowl to transfer these seasonings.
