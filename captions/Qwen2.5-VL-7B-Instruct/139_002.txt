A young man is standing in a kitchen, preparing to cook a steak. He is wearing a grey t-shirt with the word "Astros" on it and khaki shorts. He is holding a bottle of seasoning and is sprinkling it onto a large piece of raw steak that is placed in a black cast iron skillet on the counter. The kitchen has white cabinets and a stainless steel sink. There is a bottle of wine on the counter and a roll of paper towels next to it. The man appears to be focused on his task and is carefully seasoning the steak.
