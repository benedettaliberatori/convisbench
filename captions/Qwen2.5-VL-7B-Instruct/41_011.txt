The video shows a close-up of a person's hands as they prepare a dish. The person is holding a small glass bowl filled with sliced strawberries and is carefully adding them to a larger white bowl that already contains a mixture of ingredients, including what appears to be oats or a similar grain, nuts, and possibly some seeds or spices. The background is slightly blurred but shows a domestic setting with a patterned fabric, possibly a tablecloth or a piece of furniture, and a colorful object that looks like a toy or a decorative item. The focus remains on the hands and the bowls throughout the video.
