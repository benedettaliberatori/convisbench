A chef, wearing a black baseball cap and apron, is seen in a kitchen setting. He pours oil into a hot pan, then places patty-like food items onto the pan. The food appears to be some type of meat or patty, as it is being cooked in the pan. The chef then uses tongs to flip the food item over and continues cooking it on the other side. Finally, he removes the cooked food item from the pan and places it onto a plate.
