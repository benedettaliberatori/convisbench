A man is sitting in a kayak on a lake, holding a fishing rod and reeling in a fish. He is wearing a blue shirt, tan pants, and a life jacket. The camera pans around the lake showing trees on the shore. The man catches a fish and smiles as he holds it up for the camera. The video then fades to black.
