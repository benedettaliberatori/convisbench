A man stands in a well-lit room with exposed brick walls and wooden floors. He is wearing a black t-shirt with white text, light grey jeans, and bright red shoes. He has blonde hair styled in pigtails and is holding a measuring tape. The room contains a dark brown leather armchair, a white coffee table with a small plant on it, and a gray sofa. The floor is covered with a large piece of paper on which the man measures his own body with the tape measure.
