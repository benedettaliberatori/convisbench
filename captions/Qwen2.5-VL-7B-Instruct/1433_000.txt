A woman in a pink tank top and black leggings is performing floor slide knee tucks in a gym. She starts in a plank position with her hands on the ground and her feet together. She then slides her right foot forward to the side, lowering her body down until her upper body is parallel to the ground. She then tucks her left knee towards her chest while keeping her right leg straight behind her. She repeats this movement with her left foot, sliding it forward and tucking her right knee towards her chest. The exercise emphasizes the lower abdominal muscles and glutes.
