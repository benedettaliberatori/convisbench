A pair of hands is seen holding a ruler and a pen, placing the ruler on a piece of paper on a cutting mat. The hands then use the pen to draw a straight line along the edge of the ruler. After the line is drawn, the scissors are brought into view. The hand holding the scissors is now positioned above the line that was just drawn on the paper.
