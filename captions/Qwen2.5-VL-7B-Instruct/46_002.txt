The video shows a man sitting on a white mat with two cushions, one red and one green, placed behind him. He is wearing a dark blue shirt and black pants. The man begins by sitting up straight with his legs extended in front of him. He then bends forward, placing his hands on the ground in front of him. He slowly lowers himself down, bending at the hips until he is resting his weight on his forearms and head. He maintains this position for several seconds before slowly standing back up.
