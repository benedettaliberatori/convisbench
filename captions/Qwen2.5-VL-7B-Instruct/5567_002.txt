Two men are standing in front of shelves filled with durian fruits, talking about the quality and price of the fruit. One man is wearing a black shirt and gloves, while the other is wearing a red plaid shirt. The man in the black shirt is explaining how to identify a good quality durian. He uses his hands to show the different parts of the fruit, including the skin, flesh, and seeds. He also mentions that the price of the fruit varies depending on its size and ripeness. The video ends with the man saying that he has been selling durians for three years and wants to bring quality fruit to his customers.
