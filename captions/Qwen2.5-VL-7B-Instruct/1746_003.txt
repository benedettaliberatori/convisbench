A man is performing a workout routine on a yoga mat in a living room. He is wearing black shorts and no shirt, and he has a weightlifting belt around his waist. He begins by kneeling on the mat with his hands on a small yoga block in front of him. He then transitions into a plank position, supporting himself on his forearms. He holds this position for several seconds before transitioning back to the initial kneeling position. He repeats this sequence several times, demonstrating good form and control throughout.
