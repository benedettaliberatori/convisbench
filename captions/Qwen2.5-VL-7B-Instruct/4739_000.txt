A woman is performing mountain climbers on a blue exercise mat. She starts in a plank position with her hands on the mat and her feet together. She then brings one knee up towards her chest, keeping her core engaged and her back straight. She repeats this movement, alternating legs, for several repetitions. The woman is wearing a colorful tank top and black leggings. There are two dumbbells placed on the mat next to her.
