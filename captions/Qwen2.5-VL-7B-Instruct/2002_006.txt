A hand is seen pouring olive oil onto a large piece of raw steak placed on a wooden cutting board. The steak appears to be a ribeye or a similar cut, with visible marbling and a pinkish-red color indicating its freshness. The hand then uses a knife to spread the oil evenly across the surface of the steak. In the background, there is a lemon and a glass container, suggesting that these ingredients might be used later in the cooking process. The setting appears to be outdoors, possibly on a patio or deck, with natural light illuminating the scene.
