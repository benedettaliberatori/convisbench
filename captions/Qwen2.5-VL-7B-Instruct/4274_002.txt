A woman stands in front of a white wall, holding a black helmet with both hands. She is wearing a light blue cycling jersey with a cartoon elephant on it and black shorts. She has a tattoo on her left arm and a red wristband on her right wrist. She puts the helmet on her head and adjusts it with both hands. She then pulls down her jersey to reveal a white undershirt underneath. She continues to adjust the helmet and then looks directly at the camera.
