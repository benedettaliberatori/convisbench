The video begins with a view from inside a blue barrel, which is being pushed forward by a hand. The barrel is moving through a narrow, industrial-looking corridor with yellow lines on the walls and ceiling. As the barrel progresses, it passes through a series of metal doors that open to reveal shelves filled with various items. The camera then shifts to show a hand holding a shotgun, which is pointed forward as the barrel continues its journey through the corridor. The video ends with the barrel passing through another set of metal doors, revealing more shelves behind them.
