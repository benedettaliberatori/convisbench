A person is using a curling iron to style a wig on a mannequin head. The wig has long, straight hair with a gradient color from blonde at the roots to a darker shade at the ends. The person is holding the curling iron in their right hand and is carefully wrapping sections of the wig around it. They are moving the iron back and forth along the length of the hair, creating curls. The background is plain white, which helps to highlight the colors of the wig and the action of the curling iron.
