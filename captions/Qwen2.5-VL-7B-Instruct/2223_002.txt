The snowboarder, wearing a black jacket with the "LAAX Open" logo and a red hat with the "Red Bull" logo, stands in front of a snowy landscape. He is also wearing a black beanie and a black face mask. The background includes a ski lift and some power lines, indicating that the location is likely a ski resort or a similar setting.
