The video shows a woman in her kitchen preparing a healthy meal. She is wearing a leopard print apron and has long brown hair. She begins by cutting an egg into half and placing it on a plate. Next, she uses an air fryer to cook the egg. After that, she adds some spices to the egg, including a jar of Nutella and a bottle of curry powder. Finally, she slices a piece of avocado and places it on top of the egg. The kitchen is well-lit and features modern appliances, including an orange refrigerator and a stainless steel sink.
