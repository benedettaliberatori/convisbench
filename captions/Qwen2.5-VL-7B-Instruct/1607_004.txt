A woman is practicing yoga on the beach. She is wearing light blue leggings and a light orange sports bra. She starts in a plank position, with her arms extended in front of her and her hands shoulder-width apart. She then bends at the hips, lowering her body towards the mat. She maintains a straight line from her head to her heels. She then returns to the plank position and repeats the movement several times. The ocean can be seen behind her, with waves crashing against the rocks. The sky is clear and blue, indicating that it is a sunny day.
