A man stands on a red yoga mat in a room with a white wall and wooden trim. He is wearing a white shirt and black pants. He bends over and places his hands on his knees, then slowly lowers his head down towards the mat. He holds this position for a few seconds before returning to his upright position. He repeats this movement several times.
