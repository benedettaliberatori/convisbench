The video shows a woman performing a side plank hold exercise. She is on her left elbow, with her right knee bent and foot flat on the ground. Her core muscles are engaged as she maintains this position. The environment appears to be a well-lit, minimalist room with a white wall and large windows, allowing natural light to fill the space. There are two potted plants, one to the left and one to the right of the woman, adding a touch of greenery to the setting. A counter is visible behind her, and there's an exercise mat on the floor for her to rest on during the exercise. The video is part of a fitness routine designed to tone the waist, as indicated by the title. The text overlay includes tips in Chinese, suggesting that the exercise should maintain the waist and strengthen the core muscles. The video also features a progress bar at the bottom, which updates as the woman performs the exercise.
