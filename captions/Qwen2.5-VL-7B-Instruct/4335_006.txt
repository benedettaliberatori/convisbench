The video starts with a close-up shot of various fabric pieces laid out on a blue surface. These pieces include a long strip, two smaller rectangular pieces, and a curved piece. The camera then pans to show a person wearing a white shirt sitting at the table. The person is holding a small square piece of fabric and begins to sew it onto one of the longer fabric strips. The text "Line the side pieces up along the sides of the midstrip. Sew." appears on the screen as the person continues to sew.
