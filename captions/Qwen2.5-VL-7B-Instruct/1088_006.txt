The video starts with a close-up of a person's hand holding an orange comb and measuring the length of another person's hair with a black ruler. The ruler is then removed, and the comb is used to section off the hair. Next, the person's hair is brushed and styled. A blow dryer is then used to dry the hair, and the person uses a small flat iron to straighten sections of their hair. Finally, the hair is combed again, and the person is shown with their hair styled and looking straightened.
