The video shows two young men playing American football on an outdoor field. The first man, wearing a white and green sleeveless shirt with the number 23, is preparing to throw a football. He stands on a red marked area of the field, which appears to be a practice or training area. The second man, wearing a gray shirt and maroon shorts, runs towards the quarterback. The quarterback throws the football, and it arcs through the air towards the running back.
