A large, cooked steak is placed on a white plate. A hand holding a small glass bowl pours a thick, creamy sauce over the steak. The sauce appears to be a mixture of butter, garlic, and possibly some herbs or spices, as it coats the surface of the steak evenly. The steak has a dark, caramelized exterior with visible grill marks, indicating it has been cooked to a medium-rare level. The sauce is poured from above, creating a glossy sheen on the steak's surface. The background is a wooden surface, likely a table or countertop.
