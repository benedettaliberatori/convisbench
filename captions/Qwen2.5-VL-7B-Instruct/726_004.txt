The video shows a close-up of a person's hands interacting with a small, rectangular device that appears to be a wallet or a similar item. The person is using a small tool, likely a SIM card ejector pin, to remove a SIM card from the device. The SIM card is inserted into a slot on the side of the device, and the person carefully pulls it out using the ejector pin. The background is blurred, but it seems to be an indoor setting with a dark surface. The focus is on the action of removing the SIM card, highlighting the functionality of the device.
