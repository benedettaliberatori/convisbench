A man is performing a wall handstand static hold exercise. He starts by bending down and placing his hands on the wall at shoulder height. He then lifts his body up, extending his arms and legs to form a straight line from head to heels. He holds this position for several seconds before slowly lowering himself back down to the starting position. The man appears to be wearing a black shirt and shorts.
