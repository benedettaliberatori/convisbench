A small campfire burns brightly on a bed of charcoal. The fire is surrounded by three pieces of wood, which are being lit with matches. A hand appears in the frame and uses a lighter to ignite the matches. The flame from the matches ignites the wood, creating a small spark that quickly grows into a larger flame. The camera then pans out to show a group of people gathered around the fire. They are all wearing hats and jackets, and some are sitting on folding chairs. The fire crackles and the smoke rises into the air. The group seems to be enjoying a warm day outdoors.
