A woman is practicing yoga on the beach. She is wearing an orange sports bra and grey leggings. She starts in a lunge position, with one knee on the ground and the other leg extended forward. She then bends her extended leg, placing her foot on the ground behind her. Her hands are placed on the mat in front of her. The video is a slow-motion shot, which allows for a clear view of her movements. The beach is sandy and there is a pier in the background. The sky is overcast and the ocean is calm. There are no other people visible in the video.
