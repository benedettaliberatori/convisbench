A woman with blonde hair is performing a bent over rear delt row exercise. She is wearing a red sports bra and black leggings, and her hair is tied back in a ponytail. She is holding a dumbbell in each hand and bending over at the waist, keeping her back straight. Her right arm is extended down by her side, while her left arm is bent, pulling the dumbbells up to her right shoulder. She holds this position for a moment before slowly lowering the weights back down to her side.
