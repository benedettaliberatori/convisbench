The video starts with a close-up shot of a person's hands tying a fishing knot on a fishing line. The camera then pans out to show a man standing on a rocky cliff overlooking the ocean, holding a fishing rod. He is wearing a black jacket and sunglasses and appears to be fishing. The ocean is choppy with waves crashing against the rocks. The man is reeling in his line and seems to be having fun. Another man, wearing a white hat and red shorts, walks up to him and they shake hands. The man in the black jacket then casts his line into the water and begins to reel it in again. The video ends with a shot of the man on the rock looking out at the ocean.
