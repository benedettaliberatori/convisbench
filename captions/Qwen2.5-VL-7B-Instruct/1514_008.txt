A woman is performing a workout on a beach. She is wearing a blue sports bra and matching leggings. She starts by sitting on her mat with her legs extended in front of her. She then brings her right leg up and places it behind her left knee, keeping her back straight. She holds this position for a few seconds before returning to the starting position. She repeats this exercise with her left leg. The video shows her performing this exercise eight times in total.
