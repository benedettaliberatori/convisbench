The video begins with a close-up shot of a road, which transitions into a medium shot of the back of a white van. The camera pans down to show the open trunk, revealing various items, including what appears to be camping gear and possibly some tools or equipment. A hand then reaches into the trunk, pulling out a blue license plate with the text "X10870" on it. The hand then moves the license plate to reveal a different one underneath, which is white with the text "SIENNA". The camera zooms in on this new license plate as the hand places it back into the trunk.
