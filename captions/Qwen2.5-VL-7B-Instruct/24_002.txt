A person is grilling meat over an open flame. They are using a black metal tray to hold the meat and a long-handled spatula to turn it. The meat appears to be sausages or hot dogs, and they are cooking them on a small portable grill. The grill is made of metal and has a few holes for ventilation. There are some wooden logs next to the grill, likely used to fuel it. On the table in front of the grill, there is a white plate and a roll of paper towels. The setting appears to be outdoors, possibly at a campsite or picnic area.
