A woman is kneeling on the floor next to a fireplace, surrounded by various camping gear. She is wearing a green Patagonia sweater and has her hair tied up. The fireplace is made of stone and has neatly stacked logs. The woman is holding a large blue backpack in her hands and talking about it. She then puts the backpack down and picks up a smaller blue bag, continuing to talk. She then picks up another piece of gear and talks about it as well. She then stands up and walks towards the camera.
