A man wearing a camouflage shirt and cap stands next to two mountain bikes in a grassy field. He holds the handlebars of one bike with his right hand and gestures with his left as he speaks. A golden retriever dog walks behind him, sniffing the ground. The man appears to be explaining something about the bikes, possibly their features or how they're used for hunting.
