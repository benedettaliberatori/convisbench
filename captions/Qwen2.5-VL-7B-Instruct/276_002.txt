The video starts with a black screen, followed by a close-up shot of a person holding a fishing rod on a boat. The person is wearing a blue sweater and is casting the fishing line into the water. As the camera pans up, we see the person's feet on the floor of the boat. The person then reaches for a fish that has just been caught and holds it up to show it off. The camera then pans back down to the person's feet, which are still on the floor of the boat.
