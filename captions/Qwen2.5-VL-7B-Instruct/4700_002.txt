The video begins with a view from the back of a cyclist, showing them riding on a road surrounded by trees and greenery. The cyclist is wearing a helmet and a black outfit, and they are riding in a group with other cyclists. The camera then cuts to a map of the route, which shows the distance and time it will take to complete the ride. The map also shows the elevation of the route. The video then cuts back to the cyclist, who is now riding at a higher speed and power output. The video ends with a shot of the cyclist's top results on their cycling app.
