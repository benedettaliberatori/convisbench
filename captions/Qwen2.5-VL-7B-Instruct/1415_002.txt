The video begins with a first-person perspective of someone walking through an indoor shooting range. The person is holding a handgun and is moving quickly, aiming the gun at targets on the walls. The targets are numbered from 1 to 40, arranged in a grid pattern. As the person moves forward, they pass by a metal cage and continue down a hallway. The environment is well-lit, with concrete walls and floors, and the targets are clearly visible. The person's hand is steady as they aim the gun, and the sound of gunfire can be heard in the background. The video ends with the person continuing down the hallway, still holding the gun.
