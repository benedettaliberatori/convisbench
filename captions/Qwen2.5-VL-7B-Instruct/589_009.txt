The video begins with a title card that reads "Farm to Fork." The scene then transitions to a kitchen setting where a person is preparing food. The individual is wearing a gray hoodie and is standing at a counter. They are using a brush to spread oil on a black cast iron skillet. In the background, there is a white cabinet with a red mixer on top and a sign that says "FARM to FORK." The person appears to be focused on their task, carefully spreading the oil evenly across the surface of the skillet.
