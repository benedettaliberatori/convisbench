A person is performing a back extension exercise on a mat outdoors. They lie flat on their back, with their legs extended and their arms by their sides. The individual slowly lifts their upper body off the mat, keeping their feet touching the ground. This movement targets the lower back muscles. The background shows a residential area with a parked camper truck and a house. The scene is bright and clear.
