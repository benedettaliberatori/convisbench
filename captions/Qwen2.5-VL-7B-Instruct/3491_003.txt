A person is performing a handstand on their hands and knees in a gym. They are wearing a black shirt, black shorts, and red shoes. The person's legs are extended straight out in front of them, and their arms are fully extended behind them. Their body is straight, with their shoulders directly above their hands and their hips aligned directly over their knees. The person holds the handstand for a few seconds before lowering themselves back to the starting position.
