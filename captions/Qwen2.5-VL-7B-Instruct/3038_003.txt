A pair of hands is holding an open brown leather wallet against a teal background. The wallet has a zipper closure and is open to reveal its interior compartments. The hands are carefully placing a stack of Korean banknotes into the wallet, one by one. The banknotes are neatly stacked and appear to be of different denominations. The hands then close the wallet zipper, securing the banknotes inside.
