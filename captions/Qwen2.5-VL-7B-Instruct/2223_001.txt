The video starts with a close-up of a person's eyes, which appear to be goggles, and then transitions to a woman sitting on a chair on a snowy slope. She is wearing a pink jacket, black gloves, and a black backpack. The background shows a beautiful mountainous landscape with snow-covered peaks under a clear blue sky. The woman appears to be in a relaxed and happy mood, smiling at the camera. The video also includes text that reads "ANNA GASSER AUT 2ND PLACE LAAX-OPEN 2017," indicating that she is an Austrian ski athlete who won second place in the Laax Open competition in 2017.
