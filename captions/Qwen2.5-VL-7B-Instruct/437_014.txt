A large, cooked steak sits on a wooden cutting board. The steak has a rich, dark brown crust with visible grill marks, indicating it has been cooked to perfection. A hand enters the frame from the left side and sprinkles salt over the top of the steak. The salt crystals glisten slightly, reflecting the light. The hand then moves out of the frame, leaving the steak with a generous layer of salt on its surface. The background is a kitchen setting with a wooden countertop and a knife resting nearby.
