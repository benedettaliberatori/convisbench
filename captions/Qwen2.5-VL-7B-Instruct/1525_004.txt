A young man is performing a backflip on a blue gymnastics mat in an indoor gym. He begins by walking towards the mat and then leaps up, extending his body into a forward roll. The camera follows him as he flips through the air, landing back on the mat. The gym is well-lit and has various equipment and posters on the walls.
