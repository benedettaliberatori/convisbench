The person on the left is wearing a red and black checkered shirt, while the person on the right is dressed in a black polo shirt with a logo on the chest and is wearing gloves. The individual in the black shirt is holding a durian fruit and appears to be explaining something about it. The background features shelves filled with various durians, indicating that this might be a durian shop or a demonstration area. The text overlay on the screen suggests that they are discussing the characteristics of the durian, specifically mentioning its round shape and the fact that the spikes are far apart. The overall setting seems to be educational or informative, aimed at educating viewers about the durian fruit.
