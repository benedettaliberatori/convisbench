Two fencers are engaged in a practice match. They are both wearing white uniforms and masks, and they are holding their swords in a ready position. The fencer on the left is lunging forward with his sword, while the fencer on the right is parrying with his sword. The fencer on the right then counters by lunging forward with his sword. The fencer on the left then parries again, and the two continue to exchange attacks and defenses.
