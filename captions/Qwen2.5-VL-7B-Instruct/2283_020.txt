A chef, wearing a black apron and black gloves, stands at a counter and serves a dish of meatballs covered in a rich red sauce over white rice. He uses a spoon to scoop up the meatball and place it onto the plate. The camera then shows the chef in a kitchen wearing a grey baseball cap with an "LA" logo and a gold chain around his neck. He speaks to the camera while gesturing with his hands and then serves a second meatball onto the plate. The camera then cuts back to the first plate and the chef places a forkful of the meatball onto the plate. He continues speaking to the camera while gesturing with his hands.
