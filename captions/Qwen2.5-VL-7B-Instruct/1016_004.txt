A can with an orange tab is being placed on top of a metal cylinder that is on fire. The can is filled with black beans. The flame is burning steadily and the can is tipping slightly due to the heat. The camera pans up to show the entire setup, which includes a stove and a pot on it. The can is then lifted off the stove and the camera zooms out to show the entire setup. A woman walks past in the background.
