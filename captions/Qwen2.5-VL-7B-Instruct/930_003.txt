The video begins with a close-up shot of a soldier's gloved hand holding a wooden stick, which is then used to cut a log on the ground. The camera then cuts to a wider shot, showing two soldiers in camouflage uniforms working together to cut the log. They use axes to chop the wood, and the sound of the axes hitting the log can be heard. The soldiers then carry the chopped wood away from the scene. The video ends with a shot of the soldiers walking away from the camera.
