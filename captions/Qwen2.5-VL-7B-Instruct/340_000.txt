A soccer player in a yellow jersey is seen taking a penalty kick. He takes a few steps back, then runs towards the ball and kicks it with his right foot. The ball flies through the air and hits the crossbar. The goalkeeper, dressed in green, dives to his left but fails to stop the ball from going into the net. The crowd erupts in cheers as the player celebrates his goal.
