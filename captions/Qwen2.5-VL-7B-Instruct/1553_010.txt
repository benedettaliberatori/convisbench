A person wearing a pink apron is rolling out dough on a wooden cutting board. They use a wooden rolling pin to flatten the dough, then fold it in half and roll it again. They continue to fold and roll the dough until it is thin and square. The person then uses their hands to shape the dough into a triangle.
