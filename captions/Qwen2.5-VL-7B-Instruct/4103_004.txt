The video starts with a view of a tent on a rocky hillside, with some equipment and supplies outside. The camera pans to show the surrounding landscape, which is mostly barren and covered in dry grass and rocks. The sky is cloudy and overcast, with low-lying clouds. The camera continues to pan across the landscape, showing more of the rocky terrain and the distant mountains in the background. The video ends with a close-up shot of the tent and a finger pointing at it.
