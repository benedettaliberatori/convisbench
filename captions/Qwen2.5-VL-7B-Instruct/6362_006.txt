The video begins with a shot of an oven, which is open and has a digital display showing the time as 2:45 PM. A hand reaches into the frame and closes the door of the oven. The camera then cuts to a close-up shot of a pie, which appears to be a pumpkin pie. The camera then zooms out to reveal the entire pie, which is placed on a white plate. The camera then cuts to a shot of a slice of the pie, which is topped with whipped cream and nuts. Finally, the camera cuts to a shot of a person eating a slice of the pie.
