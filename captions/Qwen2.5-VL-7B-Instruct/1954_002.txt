The video begins with a clear glass mason jar placed on a wooden surface. A hand then pours blue gel food coloring into the jar, followed by a white liquid, likely water or milk. The jar is then inverted and placed over a small blue bowl. The scene transitions to an oven where the jar is carefully placed inside. The oven door closes, and the door handle is shown in detail before closing. Finally, the oven's control panel is displayed, showing the time and temperature settings.
