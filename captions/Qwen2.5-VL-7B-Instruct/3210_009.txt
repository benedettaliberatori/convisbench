A shirtless man with tattoos on his arms is standing in the middle of a deserted road, facing away from the camera. He is holding two jump ropes with both hands and begins to jump rope, moving his arms and legs rhythmically. After finishing the jump rope routine, he turns around and starts dancing, raising his arms up and down while swaying his body to the music.
