A person is standing at a kitchen counter, preparing to bake. They are wearing a gray long-sleeve shirt and are holding a glass bowl filled with a yellow liquid, likely egg wash or milk. The person is using a wooden brush to spread the liquid evenly across a large, flat piece of dough that is placed on the counter. The dough appears to be rolled out and is spread out in a circular shape. The kitchen has a marble countertop and stainless steel appliances, including an oven. The person is focused on their task, carefully brushing the dough to ensure it is well-coated.
