A woman is holding up a piece of paper with a black and white drawing on it, which appears to be a Halloween-themed pattern or template. The drawing includes various Halloween symbols such as pumpkins, witch hats, and ghost faces. Behind her, there is a shelf with various items, including a sign that says "Comment Like Subscribe," several packages of yarn in different colors, and some Halloween decorations like a jack-o'-lantern and a witch hat. The woman is wearing a black and white polka dot shirt and is smiling while looking at the camera. She seems to be promoting a crafting or DIY project related to Halloween.
