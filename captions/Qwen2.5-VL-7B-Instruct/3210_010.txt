A shirtless man stands on an empty road, with his arms outstretched and knees bent. He then takes a few steps forward, bending his knees further to lower his body towards the ground. He then extends his arms out to the sides and bends his knees again, bringing his body closer to the ground. Finally, he places his hands on the ground and extends his legs behind him, forming a plank position. The video ends with the words "4. TRYING TRICKS YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED YET" displayed on the screen.
