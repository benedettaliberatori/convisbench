The video shows a person's hands mixing soil and compost together in a black container. The soil is dark brown and appears to be rich in nutrients, while the compost is a mix of organic matter such as leaves, twigs, and other plant materials. The person's hands are covered in dirt and compost as they mix the two materials together. The compost is being added to the soil in small piles, and the person is using their fingers to break up the compost and mix it into the soil. The compost is being added in small amounts at a time, and the person is carefully mixing it into the soil to ensure that it is evenly distributed. The video ends with the person's hands still mixing the soil and compost together.
