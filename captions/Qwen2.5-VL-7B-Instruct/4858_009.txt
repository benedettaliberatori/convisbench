A hand wearing a purple bracelet reaches into an Instant Pot filled with cooked beans. The hand stirs the beans with a spoon, ensuring they are evenly mixed. The beans appear to be a light brown color, suggesting they might be lentils or chickpeas. The Instant Pot is placed on a wooden surface, and the background is blurred, keeping the focus on the beans and the hand stirring them.
