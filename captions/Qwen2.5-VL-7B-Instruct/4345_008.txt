The video shows a group of people practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu on a mat. One person, wearing a white gi with a black belt, is demonstrating a move. They start by sitting on the ground and then transition into a position where they are on all fours. They then lift their upper body up and over their opponent, who is also wearing a white gi. The person doing the move maintains control of the opponent as they continue to hold the submission position. The other people in the background are also practicing various techniques.
