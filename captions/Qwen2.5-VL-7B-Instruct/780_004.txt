A person is slicing a red onion on a wooden cutting board with a knife. They hold the onion steady with their left hand and cut it into thin slices using a precise, controlled motion. After removing the onion from the board, they place it into a glass bowl that already contains sliced cucumbers. The person then continues to slice the onion and carefully adds it to the bowl, arranging it around the cucumber slices to ensure an even distribution. Finally, they set the onion aside and continue working with the other ingredients.
