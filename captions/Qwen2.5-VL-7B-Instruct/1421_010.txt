The video shows a close-up of a person's hands holding a small, dark-colored bottle with a dropper. The bottle appears to contain a liquid, possibly a medication or a cosmetic product. The person is using the dropper to extract a small amount of the liquid from the bottle and place it into a clear plastic container with a blue lid. The container has a small hole in the lid for dispensing the liquid. The background is a wooden surface, likely a table or countertop, with some papers and a white cloth visible. The focus is on the action of transferring the liquid from the bottle to the container.
