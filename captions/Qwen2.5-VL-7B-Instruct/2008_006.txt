A person's hand is holding a leaf of a green plant, with the background slightly blurred to emphasize the leaf. The hand rotates the leaf, showing different angles and details of its surface. There are dark spots on the leaf, possibly indicating damage or disease. The leaf has a wavy edge and is held between the thumb and index finger. The background includes some outdoor elements like a white chair and plants.
