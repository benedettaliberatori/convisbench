A person is decorating a cake with white frosting using a piping bag and a nozzle. The cake is round and sits on a white plate. The person starts by squeezing the icing onto the center of the cake, creating a circular pattern. Then, they move the icing along the edge of the cake, creating a row of evenly spaced dots. They continue to add icing to the edges, creating a decorative border around the cake.
