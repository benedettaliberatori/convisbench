The video shows a close-up of a bowl of oatmeal being prepared and topped with fresh strawberries. The sequence begins with a spoon scooping oatmeal from a pot into a white bowl. The oatmeal appears to be creamy and well-cooked, with visible oats and possibly some milk or yogurt mixed in. 

Next, the camera shifts focus to the bowl as it is placed on a striped cloth. A hand then enters the frame, holding a bunch of fresh strawberries. The strawberries are vibrant red and appear juicy and ripe. The hand carefully places the strawberries on top of the oatmeal, arranging them in a decorative pattern.

Finally, the video ends with a close-up of the finished oatmeal bowl, now topped with the neatly arranged strawberries. The overall scene is bright and colorful, emphasizing the freshness and appeal of the breakfast dish.
