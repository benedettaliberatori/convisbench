The video opens with a sign for Fook Gor Durian Farm, featuring images of durians and contact information including a phone number (017-7186880) and WhatsApp number (016-9223286). The camera then pans to show several durians displayed on tables in what appears to be a market or showroom setting. The durians are green and have spiky exteriors, typical of the durian fruit. The camera moves closer to highlight the details of the durians and the text on the sign, emphasizing the farm's origin and product.
