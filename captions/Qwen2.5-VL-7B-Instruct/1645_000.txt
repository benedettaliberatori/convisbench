A man is doing pike push-ups on a black mat in a gym. He is wearing a gray shirt and black shorts with white stripes. His hands are gripping two black handles on the mat, and his feet are on the floor. He bends his elbows until his chest is close to his thighs, then pushes himself back up to the starting position. The video shows the man doing several pike push-ups.
