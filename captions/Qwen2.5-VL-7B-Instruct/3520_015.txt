The video is a fitness tutorial that shows a woman doing a side plank hold exercise. She is wearing a black sports bra and leggings, with her hair tied back in a ponytail. She is on a yoga mat and there are two plants in the background, one on each side of her. The video has a timer on the top right corner that counts down from 28 to 1. There is also a progress bar at the bottom of the screen that shows the time left for the exercise.
