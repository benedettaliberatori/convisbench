In this video, a hand is seen using tongs to carefully ignite a small fire on the ground. The fire is contained within a small, golden-colored woven basket filled with dry grass or straw. The basket is resting on the snow-covered ground, surrounded by patches of soil and some leaf litter. The hand uses the tongs to place a lit match inside the basket, igniting the dry grass or straw and causing it to catch fire. The flames are visible, spreading through the material, while the surrounding snow remains untouched. This scene depicts a simple, outdoor activity involving starting a small fire in a cold environment.
