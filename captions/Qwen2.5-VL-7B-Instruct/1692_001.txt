The video opens with a title card that reads "Robowars Australia Vivid Sydney 2015 SCARAB vs HEXTECH." The scene then transitions to a dark, indoor arena where two robotic tanks, one green and one black, are engaged in combat. The green tank is positioned on the left side of the arena, while the black tank is on the right. The green tank is initially stationary, but it quickly begins to move forward, its wheels spinning rapidly as it approaches the black tank. The two tanks face each other, their engines roaring as they prepare for battle. The green tank continues to advance, its movements becoming more aggressive as it closes the distance between the two tanks. The black tank remains stationary, its engine still running as it watches the green tank approach. The two tanks continue to face each other, their engines roaring as they prepare for the inevitable clash.
