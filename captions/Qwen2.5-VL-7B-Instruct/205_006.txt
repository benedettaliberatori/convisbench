The video starts with a close-up shot of a hand lighting a cigarette with a matchstick. The match catches fire and the smoke rises from the cigarette. The hand then reaches for a pocket knife, opening it to reveal a blade that is clean and sharp. The knife is used to carefully cut the cigarette into smaller pieces, and the pieces are placed on the ground. The video ends with the hand holding the cut-up cigarette pieces. The background is blurred but appears to be an outdoor setting with some leaves and twigs visible.
