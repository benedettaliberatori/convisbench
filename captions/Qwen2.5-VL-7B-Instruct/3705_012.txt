A man is using a digital caliper to measure the diameter of a metal rod on a lathe. He is holding the caliper with his right hand and turning the rod with his left hand. The caliper is set to zero before he begins measuring. He then turns the rod and measures it again, taking several readings. He then sets the caliper back to zero and repeats the process.
