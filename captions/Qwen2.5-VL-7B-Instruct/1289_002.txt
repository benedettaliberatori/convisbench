The video shows a person's hands with purple nail polish, knitting with two different colors of yarn: blue and green. The background is out of focus, but it appears to be an outdoor setting with tall grass and some wildflowers. The hands are manipulating the yarn and knitting needles, demonstrating a knitting technique called "casting on" where you need to cast on a number of stitches evenly divisible by six. The instructions and credit @beyondtheloops are visible on the screen throughout the video.
