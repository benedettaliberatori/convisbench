A man with a beard and tattoos on his arms is demonstrating how to style hair on a mannequin head. He is wearing a black t-shirt and has a white wristband on his left arm. The mannequin head has long, dark brown hair. The man starts by brushing the hair with a red comb, then he sections the hair into two parts and twists them together. He then pulls the hair apart and brushes it again. Finally, he uses his fingers to style the hair into a ponytail.
