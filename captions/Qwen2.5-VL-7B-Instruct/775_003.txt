The video takes place in an indoor bowling alley. Three men, two wearing black shirts and one wearing a grey shirt with "USA" printed on the back, are standing at the head of a lane. The man in the grey "USA" shirt appears to be preparing to bowl, while the other two men are watching him. The bowler takes a few steps forward and then releases the ball down the lane towards the pins. The camera remains stationary throughout the video.
