The video begins with a close-up shot of a person's hand holding a smartphone. The camera then quickly pans to the right, revealing another hand holding a red pen. The two hands are positioned close together, and the camera remains focused on them for a few seconds before slowly zooming out to show both hands and the smartphone. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an indoor setting with some indistinct objects visible. The video ends with the camera still focused on the two hands and the smartphone.
