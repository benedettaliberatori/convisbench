The video begins with a close-up shot of a green light on the end of a hose, indicating that it is turned on and ready for use. The camera then pans down to show a person's feet walking towards a garden hose lying on the grass. The person picks up the hose and walks away from the camera, heading towards a house. The camera follows the person as they walk towards the house, and the video ends with the person standing outside the house.
