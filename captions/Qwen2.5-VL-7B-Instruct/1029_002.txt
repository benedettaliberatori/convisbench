A group of hikers, dressed in orange and black, navigate a rocky trail through a desert landscape. They move cautiously, their steps steady on the uneven terrain. The camera pans around, showing the surrounding greenery and the towering red cliffs in the background. The hikers continue their trek, their figures gradually becoming smaller as they ascend the slope.
