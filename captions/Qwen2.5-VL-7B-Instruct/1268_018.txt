A woman with red nail polish is making a sauce in a blender. She starts by adding ingredients such as white wine vinegar, salt, pepper, and optional red pepper flakes. She then adds 1/2 cup of grapeseed oil and 1/4 cup of walnut oil to the blender. After blending the ingredients, she tastes the sauce and adjusts the seasoning. Finally, she pours the sauce into a glass.
