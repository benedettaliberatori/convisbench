The video starts with a scene of two men on a boat, one holding a fishing rod and the other wearing a vest with a walkie-talkie. The man holding the rod is reeling in a fish. As he reels, the fish begins to struggle and wriggle, causing it to twist and turn in his grip. The second man watches closely, seemingly ready to assist if needed. The fishing rod is held vertically, and the line is visible as it tangles around the fish's body. The water appears calm, and there are some buoys floating in the background. The sky is overcast, suggesting it might be early morning or late afternoon. The men are dressed for cold weather, indicating it could be a chilly day.
