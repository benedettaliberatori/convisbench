A man with a beard and glasses is standing in front of a table with various ingredients and tools. He is wearing a colorful Hawaiian shirt and appears to be preparing food. He is holding a corn on the cob in one hand and a knife in the other. He is peeling the corn off the cob with his fingers. The table has a cutting board, a knife, and some other ingredients. In the background, there is a grill and some posters on the wall.
