A man is lying face down on a weight bench, holding a barbell with his hands. He is performing bench press reps under the guidance of another person who is standing behind him. The person standing is demonstrating how to properly lift the barbell by holding it at the bottom of the lift and then using their hands to push the weight up. The person doing the bench press is keeping his back straight and his arms in a straight line as he lifts the barbell. They are both wearing workout clothes and they are in a gym setting.
