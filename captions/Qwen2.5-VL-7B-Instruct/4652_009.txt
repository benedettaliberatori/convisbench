The video captures a group of people exercising outdoors on a sunny day. The focus is on a woman performing a side plank exercise, with her body straight and her core engaged. She is wearing a black sports bra and purple leggings, and she has long hair tied back. Her arms are extended forward at shoulder height, and her feet are flat on the ground.

A man in a black shirt stands behind her, spotting her form as she maintains the plank position. The text "SIDE PLANK" is displayed prominently on the screen, indicating the exercise being performed. In the background, there are other people engaging in various exercises, and the surroundings include a large mural on the wall of a building and a fence. The overall scene suggests a fitness or workout session taking place in an urban environment.
