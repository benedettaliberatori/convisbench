The video begins with a first-person perspective of a dirt bike rider, wearing gloves and a helmet, as they navigate a dirt track. The rider is wearing a blue and white jersey with the number 505 on it. The track is surrounded by a large stadium filled with spectators. The rider accelerates down the track, performing jumps and maneuvers. The camera captures the rider's hands gripping the handlebars and the front wheel of the bike as they navigate the course. The rider then slows down and comes to a stop at the end of the track. The video then cuts to a scene inside a store where the rider is standing next to a display of bikes.
