A man wearing a red beanie and brown jacket is cutting branches off a small tree with a red chainsaw. The sky is overcast and the ground is covered in snow. The man is standing to the left of the tree, using both hands to hold the chainsaw and cut the branches. The branches are brown and thin, and they fall off as the man cuts them.
